\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this step we will show you the most important skills you need to navigate
 the Graphics View, namely rotating the view, zooming, panning, and selecting
 and transforming objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rotate the view, click anywhere in an open area of the graphics view
 with the left mouse button and hold it down.
 By dragging the mouse left and right you can rotate the view to the left
 or to the right.
 Similarly, by dragging the mouse up and down you rotate the model up and
 down.
 Panning works similarly as rotating, except you use the middle mouse button
 instead of the left.
 Hold down the middle mouse button and drag the mouse to pan the view.
 You can zoom in or out by holding down the right mouse button.
 Drag the mouse up to zoom in and move it down to zoom out.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsubsec:navigating"

\end_inset

 for an overview of the different methods of changing the view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selecting objects
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel4"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selection is another important aspect for interacting with the model.
 Selection requires a selection context, which tells FEBioStudio what type
 of entity you would like to select.
 The current selection context is highlighted on the toolbar and can be
 changed by clicking on the corresponding selection button.
 For instance, to select an object, first click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Select Object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button on the main toolbar (i.e.
 the button with the green ball).
 With the button selected, you can now select any object in the model by
 clicking on it with the left mouse button.
 Selecting another object will automatically unselect the first selected
 object.
 To add an object to the current selection, hold down the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key
\emph default
 when you select the object.
 Similarly, you can remove an object from the current selection by holding
 down the 
\emph on
ctrl key 
\emph default
when clicking on the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To select several objects with one motion, first choose a selection method
 from the main toolbar.
 There are three selection methods: rectangle, circle, and free form.
 For example, select the rectangle selection method.
 Now, hold down the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
 and then click and hold down the left mouse button on an empty part of
 the screen.
 With the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key 
\emph default
and left mouse button down, drag the mouse to draw a rectangle around the
 objects you wish the select.
 Once you let go of the left mouse button, all objects that are inside or
 intersect the rectangle will be selected.
 You can also use this procedure to unselect several objects at once.
 Just repeat the procedure but hold down the 
\emph on
ctrl key
\emph default
 instead of the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
.
 The other selection methods work similarly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transforming an object
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel5"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an object is selected you can transform it, which means you can translate,
 rotate, or scale it.
 To apply a particular transformation, make sure one of more objects are
 selected.
 Then click on one of the transform buttons on the toolbar.
 For example, to translate an object click on the translate toolbar button
 (i.e.
 the button with the crossed arrows).
 A triad appears on the selected object(s).
 The triad is positioned at the current pivot point, which is the center
 from which the transformation is applied.
 The triad consists of three colored arms and three colored planes.
 When you move the mouse over one of the arms or planes, it becomes highlighted.
 A highlighted arm or plane can be selected and when you drag the mouse,
 you can move the object in the corresponding direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more precise modeling you can also enter the transformation numerically
 using the 
\emph on
Transform 
\emph default
dialog which is accessible from the 
\emph on

 However, for large models the undo stack may consume a lot of memory.
 The undo stack is cleared each time you save your model.

, or by clicking the corresponding icon on the main toolbar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Run FEBio dialog box will appear.
 When clicking the Run button, FEBio Studio will write the FEBio model input
 file (usually, this file will have the job's name with the .feb file extension)
 and then start FEBio, passing the input file to it.
 Depending on the selected launch configuration, FEBio will run in the same
 process (default), or in a separate process.
 Users can create special launch configuration that will run FEBio on a
 remote server.
 The output generated by FEBio is displayed on the Log panel.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When running an FEBio model, a new item is added to the model tree.
 This item will appear under Jobs and has the job's name.
 When the model is running in FEBio, this item will show some progress and

 When FEBio completed you can open the results by double-clicking the item
 in the model tree.
 This will load the job's plot file and open it in FEBio Studio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you open a plot file in FEBio Studio you will notice that the UI changes.
 The Model and Build panels will dissapear and the Post panel will appear.
 The Build toolbar is also replaced by the Post toolbar.
 The Post panel has somewhat the same purpose as the Model panel and displays
 a tree structure of the contents of the plot file.
 It also contains some additional tabs that provide additional information
 on the results and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter

\begin_layout Standard
The Graphics View shows a 3D view of the current model.
 The user can adjust the view in several ways.
 The fastest way of maneuvering through the view is by using the mouse.
 The different mouse buttons invoke different commands depending on the
 current 
\emph on
mode 
\emph default
of the Graphics View.
 There are four buttons on the Toolbar that control this mode, namely the
 
\emph on
select
\emph default
, 
\emph on
move
\emph default
, 
\emph on
rotate 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
scale 
\emph default
buttons.
 The current mode is indicated by the button that is highlighted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the Graphics view mode, the view can be rotated by dragging
 the mouse button outside any geometry while holding down the left mouse
 button.
 A similar action but with the right mouse button down allows the user to
 zoom the view.
 The user can pan the current view by holding down the middle mouse button.
 Objects and items can be selected in all four Graphics view modes.
 To select an object or item (e.g.
 part, surface, edge), bring the mouse cursor over the object or item, and
 click on it with the left mouse button.
 To add objects or items to the current selection, hold down the shift button
 while clicking on the object or item.
 To add several objects or items, drag the mouse while holding down the
 shift button and left mouse button.
 To deselect objects or items, the same operations can be performed, only
 this time, hold down the ctrl button instead of the shift button.
 To deselect all objects or items at once, click in an empty area of the
 Graphics View.
 There are also several menu items that allow you to modify the current
 selection.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, FEBio Studio renders the model using 
\emph on
perspective projection
\emph default
 in the Graphics View.
 By right-clicking with the mouse button a popup menu shows up under the
 cursor that allows the user to toggle between perspective and orthographic
 projection.
 In addition, this menu provides some buttons that allows the user to quickly
 orient the geometry along one of the three coordinate axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Graphics View is in one of three transform modes (move, rotate
 or scale) a triad will appear in the center of the selection.
 When moving the mouse over the triad, one of its arms may highlight, indicating
 that this arm can be selected.
 To apply a transformation to the current selection, bring the mouse cursor
 over one of the triad arms so that it highlights.
 Next, drag the mouse button while holding down the left mouse button.
 Releasing the left mouse button will let go of the arm and finish the transform
ation.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Tools Panel
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel55"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This panel defines a few specialized tools that can be useful for very specific
 tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Area Calculator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool calculates the surface area A of selected faces.
 It also projects this surface area along the three coordinate directions
 as Ax, Ay and Az.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Quadric Fit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool fits a quadric surface to the selected faces.
 Quadrics include ellipsoids, cylinders and cones.
 The general equation fitted to the data is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}F\left(X,Y,Z\right) & =C_{0}X^{2}+C_{1}Y^{2}+C_{2}Z^{2}\\
 & +C_{3}YZ+C_{4}ZX+C_{5}XY\\
 & +C_{6}X+C_{7}Y+C_{8}Z+C_{9}=0
\end{aligned}
\,.
\]

\end_inset

This equation may be rewritten in matrix form as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F\left(X,Y,Z\right)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
X & Y & Z\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
C_{0} & C_{5} & C_{4}\\
C_{5} & C_{1} & C_{3}\\
C_{4} & C_{3} & C_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
Y\\
Z
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
C_{6} & C_{7} & C_{8}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
Y\\
Z
\end{array}\right]+C_{9}=0\,.
\]

\end_inset

Once the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}-C_{9}$
\end_inset

 are obtained, the principal axes of the quadric may be found by evaluating
 the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 and eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{v}_{0},\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 coefficient matrix,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
C_{0} & C_{5} & C_{4}\\
C_{5} & C_{1} & C_{3}\\
C_{4} & C_{3} & C_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[Q\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{0} & 0 & 0\\
0 & c_{1} & 0\\
0 & 0 & c_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[Q\right]^{T}\,,
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[Q\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
v_{0x} & v_{1x} & v_{2x}\\
v_{0y} & v_{1y} & v_{2y}\\
v_{0z} & v_{1z} & v_{2z}
\end{array}\right]\,.
\]

\end_inset

Then, in the basis of these eigenvectors, the equation of the quadric may
 be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F\left(x,y,z\right)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
x & y & z\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{0} & 0 & 0\\
0 & c_{1} & 0\\
0 & 0 & c_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{6} & c_{7} & c_{9}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right]+c_{9}=0\,,
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right]=\left[Q\right]^{T}\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
Y\\
Z
\end{array}\right]\,,\quad\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{6}\\
c_{7}\\
c_{8}
\end{array}\right]=\left[Q\right]^{T}\left[\begin{array}{c}
C_{6}\\
C_{7}\\
C_{8}
\end{array}\right]\,,\quad c_{9}=C_{9}\,.
\]

\end_inset

The different types of quadric surfaces are described on Wikipedia (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric"

).
 To reduce the above equation to one of the forms presented there, we find
 the origin 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the quadric and consider three cases:

The Repository Panel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This panel provides access to the online FEBio model repository.
 This repository is a way for FEBio users to easily access models created
 by other users, and to share models of their own from within FEBio Studio
 itself.
 The repository is not meant to be used as cloud storage for in-progress
 models, but as a means of sharing well-built, thoroughly-tested models
 with the FEBio community.
\end_layout

menu or by pressing the corresponding button on the toolbar.
 It can also be accessed using the 
\emph on
F4 
\emph default
shortcut.
 The 
\emph on
Curve Editor 
\emph default
gives an overview of all the time-dependent parameters in the model.
 FEBioStudio allows the user to define the time dependency explicitly through
 the use of so-called 
\emph on
load controllers
\emph default
.
 In an FEBio analysis, the load controller is evaluated at the simulated
 time and usually multiplies the value of the associated model parameter.
 The Curve Editor allows user to create load controllers, associate them
 with one or more model parameters, and edit the load controllers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the left panel, the model tree is presented, but only parameters that
 can be associated with a load controller will be listed here.
 Select a parameter here in order to see the load controller, if any, currently
 associated with this parameter.
 At the top of this panel, a Filter selection is available that allows you
 to show the parameters of only a specific type of model component, e.g.
 boundary conditions, material parameters, etc.
 This filter can be helpful in finding a specific parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right panel shows the current load controller associated with the parameter
 selected in the left panel.
 At the top, the load controller can be selected that will be associated

 parameter.
 Depending on the type of load controller selected, either the controller's
 properties or a graphical representation of the load controller will be
 shown in the right panel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One particularly useful type of load controller is the 
\emph on
load curve
\emph default
, which consists of 
\emph on
time,value 
\emph default
pairs that will be interpolated.
 FEBio Studio often associates a default load curve to certain parameters
 of boundary conditions and loads.
 This default load curve ramps up the value from zero to one over the unit
 time interval.
 However, all curves can be modified using the tools available at the bottom
 of the Curve Editor.
 The curve's data points are represented as dots on the view.
 These data points can be selected by clicking on them with the left mouse
 button.
 They can also be moved by click
\begin_inset Formula $+$

dragging them.
 The current (time, value) pair of the selected point is displayed on the

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Edit panel
\emph default
, one of the panels on the Build panel, gives access to the object's creation
 parameters and editing options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other feature to note at the top of both the Edit and Mesh panels is
 the Object rollout.
 This shows the name of the active object as well as its type.
 The type of the object affects what tools will be available for editing
 and meshing the geometry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An object can be converted to a different type via the 
\emph on
Convert 
\emph default
button.
 Two options are available:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Editable surface
\emph default
: An object of this type will have a surface mesh that can be modified.
 A separate volume mesh can be generated for this object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Editable mesh
\emph default
: An object of this type will only contain a volume mesh and this mesh can
 be modified if necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editable surfaces and editable meshes will be explained in detail in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editing Primitives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For primitives the same parameters as when the object was created are shown
 on the 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel.
 This allows you to change the primitives dimensions at any time.
 If the object is not a primitive, no options will be shown here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that changing the primitive parameters will discard the FE mesh if
 one was already created.
 The primitive will have to be meshed again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editing Editable Surfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\emph on
editable surface 
\emph default
is defined via a surface mesh.
 This surface mesh can be modified via the tools on the 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that changing the surface mesh of an editable surface will discard
 the FE mesh if one was already created.
 The object will have to be meshed again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sections below discuss each of the available tools in more detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Auto Partition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The surface of an editable surface can be partitioned (i.e.
 divided) into several partitions.
 By default, FEBio Studio will automatically generate a partitioning based
 on finding the crease edges.
 If for some reason the resulting partitioning is not correct, the user
 can re-run the auto-partitioning tool.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The auto-partition tool paritions the geometry into surfaces by identifying
 the crease edges.
 A crease edge is an edge between two surface facets whose normals make
 an angle that is larger than the crease angle.
 To manually create surface paritions, use the Partition tool instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Decimate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decimation is the process of decreasing the number of triangles in the mesh.
 This tool decimates the triangular surface mesh using an approximate Centroidal
 Voronoi Diagram based approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Scale
\emph default
: This option helps in creating a uniform triangular mesh.
 Scale value specifies the desired reduction in the total number of nodes
 in the final decimated mesh.
 For example a 0.4 value of scale will result in the final decimated mesh
 with 40% of current number of nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Edge Collapse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This filter collapses all edges with a length that is below the given threshold
 value.
 This can be useful for eliminating small triangles or very narrow triangles,
 which may improve the quality of the mesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fix Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool provides several options to fix specific common problems in surface
 meshes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
: removes elements that are repeated in the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remove non-manifold elements
\emph default
: removes element that have an invalid connectivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Fix winding
\emph default
: This option works only for triangular mesh.
 This option checks if the nodes of the triangle are in the same sequence
 clockwise/anti-clockwise direction for all the triangular facets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Fill all holes
\emph default
: Finds and fills the holes in the triangular mesh by adding new triangular
 faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\series default
: The minimum element size allowed.
 MMG cannot always guarantee that this criterion is met.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Global Hausdorff value
\series default
: Sets the maximum allowed distance from the triangle mesh to the locally
 interpolated quadratic surface.
 Setting this to a smaller value creates a refined mesh in areas of large
 curvature.
 Note that this is a distance, so the units are length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Gradation
\series default
: Sets the rate of transition between a refined and coarser area.
 A value close to one creates a very wide transition area.
 Larger values allow for narrower transition areas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Only remesh selection
\series default
: If checked (and a current selection is active), only the selection will
 be remeshed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used for globally remeshing the surface, or for doing a
 local mesh refinement.
 To perform a local mesh refinement, select the faces that should be refined,
 and make sure to check the

 option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Partition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Partition tool creates a partition (i.e.
 a selectable geometry surface) from the current node, edge, or face selection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool is useful when the auto-partition tool did not create a desirable
 partitioning of the surface mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Project Curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool projects a curve on the mesh and modifies the mesh locally so
 that the curve becomes a crease edge of the surface mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, select the curves (i.e.
 edges of other geometry) and assign them to the selection box.
 Then, click Apply.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Refine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool uniformly refines the mesh by splitting all elements.
 Triangles are split into 3 triangles, and quads are split into 3 smaller
 quads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Smooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Performs a simple mesh smoothing, where each node is moved towards the average
 of its neighbors.
 The new node position is defined by, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{r}_{new}=(1-\lambda)\boldsymbol{r}_{old}+\lambda\boldsymbol{r}_{c}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}_{new}$
\end_inset

is the new position, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}_{old}$
\end_inset

is the old position, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}_{c}$
\end_inset

is the average of the node neighbors, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a weight factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following parameters can be set: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Iterations
\series default
: Enter the value to repeat the smoothing operation several times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
lambda
\series default
: The weight factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in the equation above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
preserve shape
\series default
: When checked, the new nodal positions are projected back onto the original
 mesh.
 This is useful the counteract the shrinking that typically occurs when
 applying this smoothing filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
preserve edge
\series default
: When checked, nodes that were on an edge on the original geometry, are
 forced to remain on that edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Weld Nodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Weld Nodes tools merges the selected nodes that are within the specified
 tolerance.
 Any edges or faces that collapse as a result, will be removed from the
 mesh as well.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Mesh panel 
\emph default
gives access to FEBio Studio's meshing capabilities.
 As noted before, FEBioStudio was not designed to be a powerful mesh generator,
 but regardless, it has some simple mesh generation and editing features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meshing Primitives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the object is a primitive, that is, created with one of the geometry
 creation tools, the command window will list the mesh creation parameters
 for that particular object.
 Most primitives will be meshed with a so-called 
\emph on
butterfly mesh
\emph default
.
 These primitives have a simple rectangular box as center.
 The rest of the mesh is a projection from this box to the respective geometry.
 For instance, for the sphere the surface of the inner box is projected
 onto a sphere.
 This projection is segmented to create several layers of elements.
 Note that all solid primitives are composed of 8-noded hexahedral elements
 and all shell primitives are composed of 4-noded quadrilateral elements,
 although some primitives may offer different element options.
 After you change the mesh parameters simply press the 
\emph on
Apply 
\emph default
button to create the new mesh.
 To show the mesh in the Graphics View select the 
\emph on
View/Toggle Mesh lines
\emph default
 menu or use the '
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

' shortcut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Meshing Editable Surfaces
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Meshing-Editable-Surfaces"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\emph on
editable surface
\emph default
 is an object that is defined via a surface mesh.
 The surface mesh can be edited via the tools on the Edit panel.
 If the mesh is closed and composed of triangles, the object can be meshed
 using Tetgen
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
https://www.wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1
\end_layout

\end_inset

, available from the Mesh panel.
 This tool will generate a tetrahedral mesh.
 The following options can be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Element size:
\series default
 the desired size of the elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Quality:
\series default
 the desired quality of the elements.
 The quality of the element is defined as the ratio of the radius of the
 circumscribed sphere over the shortest edge length.
 The theoretical minimum is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{6}/4\approx0.621$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this is a suggestion to TetGen, and in general TetGen cannot
 guarantee that all elements will satisfy this criterion.
 In fact, setting it too low may cause TetGen to fail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Element type: 
\series default
Set the desired element type.
 Note that TetGen only generates 4-node tetrahedral elements (TET4), however,
 FEBioStudio can modify the element type after TetGen completes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Split Faces
\series default
: Allow TetGen to split surface facets if it can improve the mesh quality.
 For curved surfaces this option should not be used, since TetGen does not
 try to maintain the curvature while splitting facets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hole:
\series default
 To hollow out a part of the mesh, check this box and set the coordinates
 of a point inside the hole.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click Apply to generate the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editable surfaces can also be converted to shells.
 This is the only option available for surface meshes that are not closed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editable Meshes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the object is a so-called 
\emph on
editable mesh 
\emph default
the Mesh panel will list some mesh editing tools.
 Editable meshes don't have a geometry object associated with it so the
 mesh, or at least its surface, defines the geometry implicitly.
 This has some important consequences related to applying boundary conditions
 to an editable mesh.
 Any change to the mesh may also change the corresponding geometry and as
 a consequence any data that was associated with the previous geometry may
 become invalid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Important Note.

\series default
 
\emph on
It is best to first make the necessary modifications to an editable mesh
 before you apply any boundary conditions or loads.
 Any modifications to an editable mesh may invalidate the selections assigned
 to boundary conditions and loads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editable meshes can be edited on several levels, namely the 
\emph on
object level
\emph default
, the 
\emph on
element level
\emph default
, the 
\emph on
face level, 
\emph default
the
\emph on
 edge level, 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
node level
\emph default
.
 The element, face, edge, and node level are also referred to as the sub-object
 levels.
 When an object is an 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Auto Partition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partitions the surface, edges, and nodes of the mesh based on an angle criterion.
 If the Repartition elements is checked, the elements will be partitioned
 based on their connectivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Boundary Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For certain types of analyses (e.g.
 biphasic or computational fluid dynamics), it may be important to refine
 the mesh near the boundary to capture rapid boundary layer effects.
 The Boundary Layer tool can be used to generate a thin layer of refined
 elements.
 The tool requires a facet selection.
 It then finds the layer of solid elements adjacent to the selected faces,
 and then subdivides these elements, using the given control parameters:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
bias
\series default
: Sets the refinement gradation level.
 If equal to one, all elements will have the same size.
 If larger than one, elements will shrink as they get closer to the surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
segments
\series default
: Sets the number of divisions each boundary element will be divided in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this tool may introduce different types of elements.
 For instance, when applied to a tetrahedral mesh, the boundary layer may
 contain tetrahedral, wedge, and hexahedral elements.
 The quality of the elements in the boundary layer may also be degraded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a tetrahedral mesh was generated with TetGen (Section
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:MMG-Remesh-3D"

) and try the boundary layer tool again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Convert Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convert the element type to a different type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When converting between linear and quadratic elements, nodes are inserted
 in (or removed from) edges and faces.
 The number of elements is not affected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When converting between linear element types, elements may be split and
 the total number of elements will increase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Create shells from faces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool creates a layer of shells from a face selection.
 The shells will lie on top of the adjacent solid element.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Detach Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool detaches the element selection from the rest of the mesh.
 The detached elements will be assigned to their own part.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inflate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Create a biased mesh in an existing tetrahedral mesh, by inflating (extruding)
 the selected surface inward, producing pentahedral elements, then remeshing
 the inner domain with TetGen.
 This can be useful for analyzing boundary layer responses in the vicinity
 of the selected surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this tool, select the faces adjacent to the elements that will be
 inflated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

: the two domains are rebuilt into a single domain (as describedin Rebuild
 Mesh), using the selected crease angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Invert
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used to invert the selected elements.
 Elements that are inverted (i.e.
 turned inside-out) have negative volumes and cannot be used in an FE simulation.
 This can happen when the mesh was generated with a tool that assumes a
 different element nodal connectivity.
 This tool can be used to fix this problem.

Rebuild Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used to fix any issues related to mesh connectivity.
 It rebuilds the internal mesh data structures.
 Note that this tool may affect the mesh partitioning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool should not be used often.
 It should only be used if any other mesh operation leaves the mesh with
 an invalid internal data structure.
 Before applying this tool, you can use the Mesh Diagnostic tool to check
 if there are problems with the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Refine Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Refines the triangular shell mesh uniformly by dividing each triangular
 face into 4 smaller triangles.
 In this method, a new node is added at the center of each edge of the triangle
 and new triangles are created using these new nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Revolve Faces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the Face Extrude tool, but the selected faces are extruded by
 revolving them around an axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
axis Sets the axis orientation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rezone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used to locally rezone a mesh.
 This is useful for refining or coarsening a mesh near a boundary, without
 the need to remesh the area.
 This tool simply moves nodes around in order to obtain the desired zoning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Set Axis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tools can be used to generate local material axes on each element.
 Different algorithms can be chosen using the 
\emph on
generator 
\emph default
option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
vector The first option for generating material axes is 
\emph on
vector
\emph default
.
 This option allows you to specify the same set of material axes for all
 elements of the mesh.
 In general, this option is useful if the desired material axes are not
 aligned with the global XYZ coordinate system.
 For this option you are prompted to enter the
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 vectors that uniquely define the XYZ axes triad.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 represents the local X-direction, and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 is used to produce the local Z-direction from the cross product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the Y-direction is obtained form the right-hand rule from the cross-produ
ct 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 FEBioStudio automatically normalizes the vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
angles This option is similar to the vector option described in the previous
 section.
 It produces a uniform set of material axes using the azimuthal angle theta
 (°) and declination angle phi (°) of a spherical coordinate system as shown
 in the FEBio User's Manual.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
node-numbering This option is generally useful only when the mesh consists
 of hexahedral elements, such as hex8, hex20 and hex27 elements, created
 in a regular pattern.
 Users need to specify three nodes, n0, n1 and n2, which must have values
 between 1 and 8, representing the 8 corner nodes of a hexahedral element.
 FEBioStudio treats the line segment between nodes n0 and n1 as the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, and the line segment from n0 to n2 as the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

, from which it produces local XYZ axes as explained in vector above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
cylindrical The last option under the generator pull-down menu of Set Axes
 is the cylindrical option.This option may be used to produce local material
 axes that are aligned with a cylindrical coordinate system whose long axis
 (the local Z-direction) is along the user-specified vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and whose radial direction (the local X-direction) is along the user-specified
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 vector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Set Axis from curvature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many geometries for which the options described in the Set Axes
 section for generating material axes may not be suitable.
 For example, consider a torus geometry that includes two families of fibers,
 each oriented along one of the two principal radii of the Torus.
 Thus we may wish to generate local material axes that are aligned along
 the principal directions of curvature of the toroidal surface.
 The following options can be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this tool, first make a face selection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
generator This option determines who to approximate the local surface in
 order to estimate the principal axes of curvature.
 For general surface, choose 
\emph on
spline
\emph default
, but if the surface is a quadric surface (e.g.
 cone, cylinder, ellipsoid), the 
\emph on
quadric 
\emph default
option may perform better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
whole_part The box labeled Whole part ensures that local material axes are
 assigned to all elements inside the geometry, not just the ones right underneat
h the selected faces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool may be particularly useful with meshes that represent anatomical
 features, as typically acquired from medical images.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Set Fibers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tools can be used to generate local material fibers on each element.
 Different algorithms can be chosen using the 
\emph on
generator 
\emph default
option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
vector The first option for generating fibers is 
\emph on
vector
\emph default
.
 This option allows you to specify the same fiber vector for all elements
 of the mesh.
 For this option you are prompted to enter the fiber vector directly.
 FEBioStudio automatically normalizes the vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
node-numbering This option is generally useful only when the mesh consists
 of hexahedral elements, such as hex8, hex20 and hex27 elements, created
 in a regular pattern.
 Users need to specify two nodes, n0 and n1, which must have values between
 1 and 8, representing the 8 corner nodes of a hexahedral element.
 FEBioStudio treats the line segment between nodes n0 and n1 as the fiber
 vector .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shell Thickness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set the shell thickness for the selected shell elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Smooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option works only for triangular shell meshes.
 It smooths the mesh by iteratively moving points towards their neighbors
 and often results in better-shaped triangles and more evenly distributed
 nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

 It can be used to recreate or remesh a tet4 mesh locally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
minimum radius-edge ratio
\series default
: sets the desired quality measure for the tet mesh.

Weld Nodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weld the selected nodes together that are within a distance specified by
 the

 Welding is useful to connect touching parts together.
 However, be aware that you might create unexpected errors in your geometry
 this way since the effects of welding are not always visible.

At the top of the dialog box the name of the boundary condition can be entered.
 Alternatively, this field can be left blank to accept a default name.
 The name can also be changed later.
 Next, a drop-down list displays all the steps for which you can define
 a boundary condition.
 If you choose the 
\emph on
initial
\emph default
 step, the step will be applied in the initialization phase of the analysis
 and will remain active for all subsequent analysis steps.
 If you choose any other step, the boundary condition will only remain active
 during that step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you selected the step and the type of boundary condition, simply press
 OK to add the boundary condition to the model and edit the parameters in
 the Model Viewer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, there are two types of boundary conditions.
 There are the 
\emph on
fixed constraints 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
prescribed constraints
\emph default
.
 For a fixed constraint (e.g.
 zero displacement), the corresponding degree of freedom is kept zero throughout
 the entire analysis.
 For a prescribed constraint (e.g.
 prescribed displacement), the value of the corresponding degree of freedom
 is defined by the user.
 You may wonder why the fixed constraints are available, since you can achieve
 the same result by defining a zero value for a prescribed constraint.
 The reason is that the degrees of freedom for fixed constraints are removed
 from the linear system of equations, reducing the computational time to
 solve the linear system.
 On the other hand, since the equations are removed, no reaction loads are
 calculated for fixed constraints.
 If you need to know for instance the reaction force on a boundary, you
 need to use a prescribed displacement even if the displacement is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to know that with most prescribed constraints a default
 load curve will be associated.
 The actual value for the constraint at any given time is the product of
 the scale factor which you will enter in the properties dialog for the
 boundary condition and the value of the load curve at that time.
 Since by default the load curve will ramp from zero to one, the constraint
 value will ramp from zero to the specified value in a linear way.
 If you wish to modify the default curve you can edit it in the Curve Editor.

In FEBio, contact constraints are enforced using an 
\emph on
Augmented Lagrangian 
\emph default
approach.
 This implies that the Lagrange multipliers are only approximated to a user-spec
ified tolerance.
 The following parameters will appear in nearly all contact interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
augmented Lagrangian
\series default
: Turn the augmented Lagrangian method on or off.
 When off, a penalty method is used for constraint enforcement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
augmentation tolerance
\series default
: Set the convergence tolerance for the Lagrange multipliers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Penalty factor: 
\series default
The penalty factor controls the rate of convergence.
 A high penalty factor will try to reach the tolerance quickly, but if chosen
 too high might introduce instability into the system.
 If it is too low, convergence to within the specified tolerance might not
 be reached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sliding interfaces, there will usually be an option for 
\emph on
two-pass
\emph default
 option.
 In a usual contact implementation, the required integrations are only performed
 over one of the surfaces, usually referred to as the 
\emph on
primary 
\emph default
surface.
 If the contacting surfaces are perfectly smooth, it does not matter which
 surface acts as the primary or secondary surface.
 However, in an FE simulation the surfaces are discretized and are most
 likely non-conforming.
 Thus, the choice of primary and secondary surfaces is important and will
 introduce bias in the solution.
 It is usually advisable to select the more finely meshed surface as the
 primary.
 In the 
\emph on
two pass algorithm
\emph default
, an attempt is made to reduce the bias by performing the contact calculations
 twice, with the roles of primary and secondary surface switched for the
 second pass.
 Although it may appear that the two pass algorithm is always the best choice,
 this is not always so.
 Certain contact applications perform better using a single pass.
 See the 
\emph on
FEBio Theory Manual 
\emph default
for a more detailed description of the contact model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the contact parameters are entered the user needs to define the 
\emph on
primary 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
secondary
\emph default
 contacting surfaces.
 To do this, first close the contact interface dialog and select the contact
 interface in the Model Editor.
 In the Model Editor you will now notice two selection boxes, one for the
 primary surface and one for the secondary surface.
 The boxes work similarly as for boundary conditions.
 For instance, to add a surface of your model to the primary surface, select
 the surface in the Graphics View and press the '
\begin_inset Formula $+$

Nonlinear constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from contact, FEBio offers several types of nonlinear constraints
 that in some way constrains the solution of the finite element problem.
 In FEBio Studio, these constraints are differeniated based on whether they
 apply to surfaces or to volumetric bodies.
 Constraints that don't quite fit in either category are referred to as
 general constraints.

Similar to contact, these nonlinear constraints are enforced using an Augmented

\begin_layout Chapter
Rigid Bodies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigid bodies are bodies that are assumed to be undeformable.
 They can only move and rotate and therefore are described by 6 degrees
 of freedom, 3 for translation and 3 for rotation.
 Rigid bodies are useful for modeling very stiff objects In FEBio (and FEBio
 Studio).
 Rigid bodies have their own set of constraints, initial conditions, and
 loads.
 They can also be connected via special model components called rigid connectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigid bodies are implicitly created when a 
\emph on
rigid body 
\emph default
material is added to the model.
 This implies that in principle rigid bodies do not need any geometry.
 They are defined completely via the corresponding rigid material definition.
 The only exception is that if the rigid body interacts with other, deformable,
 parts of the model via contact, then the rigid body needs to have geometry.
 Since the rigid body is defined via its material, you can easily make a
 part of the model rigid by assigning it a rigid material.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rigid Body Constraints
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:rigid-1"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degrees of freedom of rigid bodies can be constrained in the same way
 as any other degree of freedom in the model.
 Before you can apply a constraint to a rigid body, you need to define a
 rigid body.
 In FEBioStudio, rigid bodies are implicitly defined when you create a rigid
 body material.
 A rigid body constraint can now be applied using the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Rigid Constraint 
\emph default
menu.
 It is important to note that when a rigid body is created none of its degrees
 of freedom are initially constrained.

\begin_layout Section
The Rigid Boundary Condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted above, rigid bodies don't require geometry (except when used in
 contact) and are implicitly defined via rigid body materials.
 In order to tie a deformable body to a rigid body, a special boundary condition
, the 
\emph on
rigid 
\emph default
boundary condition, is used.
 The rigid boundary condition is added as any other boundary condition (e.g.
 via the menu Physics/Add Nodal BC).
 Any selection of a deformable object (e.g.
 surface) that is assigned to this boundary condition will be tied to the
 rigid body.
 The rigid body that the selection ties to, is set as a parameter of the
 rigid boundary condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rigid boundary condition should not be used to tie two rigid parts together.
 The easiest way to tie rigid parts together is to assign them the same
 rigid body material.

When you start FEBioStudio or create a new model using the

 the 
\emph on
Initial 
\emph default
step.
 This initial step does not perform an actual analysis; instead it is a
 placeholder for the initialization phase of the analysis.
 Currently, the most important aspect of this step is that all boundary
 conditions, loads, constraints, etc.
 that are defined in this step will remain active during all subsequent
 analysis steps.
 This is different from an analysis step in that e.g.
 a boundary condition defined in an analysis step will only remain active
 during that step.

There are several types of launch configurations, each with a different
 set of fields to edit.
 With the exception of the 
\emph on
Local
\emph default
 launch configuration type, all types run your jobs on a remote server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Local
\emph default
 launch configuration type will launch the specified FEBio executable to
 run your job.
 This will be run on your current machine.
 The only field required is:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
FEBio Executable
\emph default
: The path to the local FEBio executable that you wish to run with this
 configuration
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 launch configuration type will copy your job files to a remote server via
 SFTP into the specified directory, and then run the job via SSH with the
 specified remote FEBio executable.
 To use a remote configuration, fill out the following fields:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
: The remote path to the FEBio executable that you wish to run with this
 configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Server
\emph default
: The domain name or IP address of the server that you wish to connect to
 via SSH/SFTP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Port
\emph default
: The port on your server on which the SSH service is being hosted.
 By default, this is set to 22, which is the standard port for the SSH protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Username
\emph default
: Your username on the remote machine.
 Your user account must have permissions to connect to the server via SSH.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remote Directory
\emph default
: The remote directory to which your FEBio input file will be copied, and
 which will act as the working directory for your FEBio run.
 Unless otherwise specifed in your input file, your log and plot files will
 be created here.
 This directory need not exist, and will be created automatically if it
 does not.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
PBS Queue
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
SLURM Queue
\emph default
 launch configuration types will copy your job files to a remote server
 via SFTP into the specified directory, and then add a new job to a PBS
 or SLURM queuing system.
 These launch configuration types each have all of the same fields as the
 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 type, along with a text box in which a PBS or SLURM script may be edited.
 At launch, the contents of this text box are put into a file, transfered
 via SFTP to the remote server, and run with either the 
\emph on
qsub
\emph default
 (for PBS) or the 
\emph on
sbatch
\emph default
 (for SLURM) command.
 By default, the text box contains a valid PBS or SLURM script with some
 common options set.
 For convenience, several macros have been defined, which you may use in
 your script.
 Before being written to a file and being copied to the server, these macros
 are replaced with a string unique to either the launch configuration, or
 the current job.
 These macros are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${JOB_NAME}
\emph default
: This macro will be replaced with the name of the current job as defined
 in the 
\emph on
Run FEBio
\emph default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${REMOTE_DIR}
\emph default
: This macro will be replaced with the contents of the 
\emph on
Remote Directory
\emph default
 field in the launch configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${FEBIO_PATH}
\emph default
: This macro will be replaced with the contents of the 
\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
 field in the launch configuratoin.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Custom Remote
\emph default
 launch configuration type will copy your job files to a remote server via
 SFTP into the specified directory, and then run a set of specified commands
 in series on the remote server via SSH.
 This launch configuration type has all of the same fields as the 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 type, except for the 
\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
 field.
 It also has a text box in which a custom series of commands may be written,
 one on each line.
 There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a custom script:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The same macros available in the 
\emph on
PBS Queue
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
SLURM Queue
\emph default
 launch configuration types are available for use in this script, with the
 exception of the 
\emph on
${FEBIO_PATH}
\emph default
 macro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lines starting with the '#' symbol are comments and will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Emtpy lines are ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The full string of each line will be run as a separate command on the remote
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The script written in this field is not a bash script, but rather a set
 of discrete commands which will be executed in series.
 It is of course possible to run a bash script with this launch configuration
 type, by placing the desired script on the remote server, and then running
 the script by calling it in one of the lines of the text box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This launch configuration type allows for great flexability.
 Using it, you can do pre and post processing of your FEBio jobs on a remote
 server with the click of a single button.
 Use this launch configuration type with caution, as it does not have any
 safety nets; anything you tell the remote server to do, it will do, as
 long as your user account has permissions to do it.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When an FEBio job is started using any of the remote launch configuration
 types, an SSH connection is made to the remote server.
 This requires authentication.
 If you have set up private key authentication for the specified server
 and username, the authentication will happen automatically.
 Otherwise, you will be prompted for your user account password during the
 first attempt to connect to the server.
 This password will be encrypted and stored in RAM for the duration of your
 FEBio Studio session, and will automatically used for subsequent server
 interactions until you close FEBio Studio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to retrieve the log and plot files from any of the remote launch
 configuration types, click the 
\emph on
Get Remote Files
\emph default
 button under the 
\emph on

\emph default
 properties in the 
\emph on

 The status of the PBS or SLURM queue may be checked by clicking the 
\emph on
Get Queue Status
\emph default
 button under the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Section
Using FEBio Plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio supports plugins that allow users to add new features to FEBio easily.
 As of FEBio Studio 2.0 plugins can be loaded into FEBio Studio and the model
 components defined in the plugin will be integrated in the UI.
 For example, if a plugin adds a new material, then the material will be
 available in the Material Browser.
 In addition, when using the 
\emph on
default 
\emph default
launch configuration, FEBio will automatically load all the plugins that
 were loaded in FEBio Studio so that special configuration file is needed.
 (For local and remote launch configuration you still need to prepare a
 special config file.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To load an FEBio plugin into FEBio Studio's user interface, select the menu

\begin_layout Section
Recording an animation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has the capability to record an animation of the current GV.
 To record an animation, first position and resize the capture frame so
 that it covers the desired area of the GV that will be captured.
 Next, select the 
\emph on
Record/New 
\emph default
menu.
 This opens a standard file dialog box where you can select a file format
 and enter the target filename.
 If the selected file format is an image format (.bmp, .tiff, etc.), the target
 filename will be the file template from which the actual filenames will
 be generated.
 Each frame will be stored in a separate file, where the frame number is
 appended to the file template.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you have selected a target file, you are ready for recording.
 Note that the capture frame will now be locked, so you can no longer move
 or resize it.
 If it is visible, it will turn red.
 The recording will begin in a paused state, allowing you to make some changes
 to the GV before recording begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Start 
\emph default
from the menu or press the corresponding shortcut.
 Now, all the action in the GV will be recorded to the target file.
 For example, if you press the play button, the GV will loop over all timesteps
 and each step will be recorded to the file.
 You can also rotate the GV and this will also be recorded to the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To pause the recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Pause 
\emph default
from the menu.
 To finally stop the recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Stop 
\emph default
from the menu.
 This will close the target file and unlock the capture frame.

In this chapter the different post-processing tools are discussed that FEBio
 Studio offers to display the model's data.
 The user can define a displacement map that FEBio Studio will use to deform
 the model.
 The user can also define a colormap that defines the color of the different
 parts of the model according to the corresponding element or nodal value.
 The user can also add different types of plots to display data.
 Plane cuts can be made to conveniently hide parts of the model and to inspect
 the interior of the model.

item in the View tab of the Post panel, the user can edit the properties
 of the model.
 The following properties are defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Element subdivisions: 
\emph default
defines the number of subdivision levels.
 FEBio Studio subdivides the elements in the model to improve the quality
 of the renderings.
 However, increasing the number of subdivisions will also increase the time
 it takes to render the model so use this property judiciously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render mode: 
\emph default
Sets the render mode to solid or wireframe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render undeformed outline:
\emph default
 when selected 
\emph on
yes
\emph default
, FEBio Studio will draw an outline of the model in its undeformed state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Outline color:
\emph default
 set the color for the model outlines 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Node color:
\emph default
 set the color of the nodes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Selection color:
\emph default
 set the color of selected items 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render smooth -
\emph default
 when selected 
\emph on
yes
\emph default
, FEBio Studio will render the model smoothly.
 This means that it will vary the surface normal of the model to create
 a smooth surface.
 When selected 
\emph on
no
\emph default
, flat shading is used to render the model.
 Note that smooth shading can be significantly slower than flat shading
 due to the additional calculations that FEBio Studio needs to do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shells as hexes -
\emph default
 renders all shells as hexahedral elements using the shell thickness (if
 available) to extrude the shell surface in the normal direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shell reference surface -
\emph default
 defines how FEBio Studio needs to interpret the shell surface in relation
 to the shell volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Smoothing angle -
\emph default
 identifies the hard edges in the model.
 Edges with adjoining faces that have a surface normal, whose angle is more
 than the smoothing angle, are considered hard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Displacement Map
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:displacement"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio uses the displacement map to define the deformation of the
 model at each state.
 The displacement map can be accessed in the Model Viewer by selecting the
 item entitled 
\emph on
displacement map
\emph default
 (this is a sub-item of the 
\emph on
model 
\emph default
item).
 Click on it to display the properties in the Properties Window, located
 at the bottom of the Model Viewer.
 The Displacement map has two parameters that the user can change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
is the data field that FEBio Studio will use to calculate the model's deformatio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Scale Factor: 
\emph default
sets the displacement scale factor, which can be used to scale the displacements
 when displaying the model in the Graphics View.
 (This scale factor does affect strain measures.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you must enable the displacement map by clicking on the 
\emph on
enable 
\emph default
button in the Model Viewer (this is the button with the checkmark).
 Similarly, by clicking the button again the displacement map can be deactivated
 in which case the model will not be deformed when displaying the different
 time steps.
\end_layout

Color Map
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:color"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Color Map 
\emph default
defines how FEBio Studio will calculate the color that is used to display
 the model in the Graphics View.
 The Color Map's properties can be accessed by selecting the item in the
 Model Viewer entitled 
\emph on
Color Map
\emph default
.
 The properties will then be listed in the Properties Window below.
 The following properties are defined for the color map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Data field - 
\emph default
allows the user to select the data field that FEBio Studio will use to define
 the color of the model.
 The color of the model is defined by the data field and the color gradient
 (see below).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Gradient smoothing -
\emph default
 Colors the material by drawing a fringe plot of the selected data field.
 When gradient smoothing is on, the fringe colors are smoothed to produce
 a continuous transition between fringes.
 When this option is off, a discrete set of colors is used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Color map: 
\emph default
defines the color map that will be used to color the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Nodal values -
\emph default
 FEBio Studio defines nodal data and element data.
 When displaying element data, the element data is projected to the nodes
 to produce a smooth rendering of the data.
 However, when this option is turned of, element data will be displayed
 by using a single color for each element.
 This will produce a discretized drawing of the data, but will be truer
 to the actual data since the element data is not interpolated before displaying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Range type -
\emph default
 FEBio Studio keeps track of the range of the selected data field (that
 is the minimum and maximum values).
 The user can use this option to select a 
\emph on
dynamic
\emph default
 range (range is updated for each state independently), a 
\emph on
static 
\emph default
range (range is calculate over all the states) or 
\emph on
user 
\emph default
range (user defines the minimum and maximum values).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Range divisions - 
\emph default
changes the number of fringes that will be drawn on the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Show legend -
\emph default
 allows you to toggle the displaying of the legend bar in the Graphics View.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Legen Orientation:
\emph default
 sets the orientation of the legend bar (horizontal or vertical) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
User max/ User min -
\emph default
 defines the minimum and maximum range value when using the 
\emph on
user 
\emph default
range option for 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When FEBio Studio starts, the colormap is turned off by default.
 To activate it, select the 
\emph on
enable 
\emph default
button in the Model Viewer.
 Similarly, to disable the color mapping, simply press this button again.
 When the colormap is turned off, FEBio Studio will use the material colors
 to display the model in the Graphics View.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 using a RGB color coding: a red plane is a plane whose normal is directed
 in the x-direction, a green plane has its normal in the y-direction and
 a blue plane has its normal in the z-direction.
 A general orientation uses a combination of red, green and blue to indicate
 the orientation.
 You can also hide the displaying of the plane by setting the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Chapter
Visualizing 3D Image Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has several capabilities for rendering and overlaying 3D image
 data.
 In order to visualize a 3D image, you must first load a 3D image stack
 into the active model.
 Then, you need to attach one of the 3D image rendering tools to the image
 stack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Loading 3D image data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio uses SimpleITK to read and manipulate image data, and so it
 supports reading a large number of image formats.
 At the moment, FEBio Studio does only supports single channel, 8-bit images.
 When a higher bit image is loaded in, it is scaled down to 8 bits.
 Multichannel images (including color images) cannot be read in at all.
 To load image data, select the File
\backslash
Import Image from the main menu, and then select the type of image that
 you would like to import, which will show the standard File Open dialog
 box.
 Locate the image file on the file system and click OK.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the image data will be loaded into the active model.
 Thus, if you wish to view the image on top of a FE model, you first need
 to load that model, make sure it is active one, and then load the image
 data.
 When the image data is loaded in, a 3D volume renderer will be added to
 your model, displaying the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supported Image Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Raw
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Raw images contain no header information, and so in order to import them,
 you must provide information about the physical location of the image,
 and the physical and pixel dimensions of the image.
 When you import a raw image, a dialog box will appear where you can enter
 this information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
DICOM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DICOM images are read using SimpleITK.
 In order to load in a sequence of DICOM images, simply select one of the
 DICOM files from the File Dialog.
 FEBio Studio uses builtin SimpleITK functionality to parse the header data
 of the DICOM images to locate and read all of the files that belong to
 the same dataset as the file you specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
TIFF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TIFF images are read using SimpleITK.
 To load in a TIFF image, simple select it from the File Dialog.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
OME TIFF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OME TIFF images are read using SimpleITK.
 To load in an OME TIFF image, you should select the xml file containing
 the OME header data from the File Dialog.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Image Sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a sequence of 2D image files that together make up a single
 3D image, you can load them in using this option.
 Simply select all of the images files that correspond to your image stack
 in the File Dialog.
 To ensure that they are loaded in the proper order, please make sure that
 they are organized alphabetically by file name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do not use this option to load in a sequence of DICOM files.
 See the section on DICOM images for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Image GUI Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has various GUI elements dedicated to viewing and manipulating
 image data.
 Some of these GUI elements only appear when an image is selected from the
 model tree in an open model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Properties Box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image properties box will appear in the Model panel when you select
 an image in the model tree.
 The box has three tabs: 
\emph on
Properties
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Filters
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Histogram
\emph default
.
 The Properties tab shows the physical bounds of the image in real space,
 and allows you to edit them.
 The Filters tab allows you to add, edit, and apply various filters to the
 images (please see the section on Filters for more information).
 The Histogram tab displays a histogram of the data from the selected image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
3D Image Settings Panel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3D Image Settings Panel will only be visible after an image has been
 selected.
 It allows you to customize various display settings for the current image.
 These display settings will be remembered for each image, and will be used
 across all display modes for the image.
 The settings include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Alpha Scale:
\emph on
 
\series default
\emph default
Sets the overall alpha scale, which scales the transparency of the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Gamma correction:
\series default
 Sets the gamma correction factor, which applies a nonlinear scaling of
 the image intensity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hue/Saturation/Luminance: 
\series default
Sets the hue (or color), saturation, luminance level of the primary color.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Intensity: 
\series default
Set the minimum and maximum cutoff image intensity.
 Voxels with an intensity below the minimum (maximum) value will be rendered
 with a transparency set to the value of the minimum (maximum) value of
 the
\emph on
 alpha range
\emph default
 setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Alpha Range:
\series default
 Sets the minimum and maximum alpha (transparency) values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Clip X/Y/Z: 
\series default
Sets the min and max image clipping values for the X, Y, and Z planes.
 This allows users to only show a region of interest instead of the whole
 3D image.

\begin_layout Subsection
Slice View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To access the Slice View, click the Slice View button on the Image Toolbar.
 This view shows slices of the image in each of the cardinal directions,
 along with a 3D render of the image which shows the corresponding location
 of each of the slices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below each of the slices, the direction of the slice is displayed along
 with the index of the slice in that direction and a slider.
 You can change which slice is displayed by either editing the slice index
 number, dragging the slider, or hovering over the slice and scrolling with
 your mouse wheel.
 As a given slice is moved, the corresponding slice on the 3D render will
 move with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Slice Sequence View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To access the Slice Sequence View, click the Slice Sequence View button
 on the Image Toolbar.
 This view allows you to automatically step through the slices of your image
 at a fixed interval.
 This is particularly useful if your image data consists of 2D images taken
 at different times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below the slice, there are various controls for this view.
 The Play/Pause button will start or stop the animation.
 The Interval value is the amount of time in milliseconds that the view
 will pause between each slice.
 Its default value is 40ms, which corresponds to 25 frames per second.
 The Slice Direction dropdown allows you to change from which direction
 the slice be shown.
 The number and slider next to the Slice Direction dropdown show the current
 slice index and relative slice position.
 The slice index can be changed manually by editing the slice index number,
 dragging the slider, or hovering over the slice and scrolling with your
 mouse wheel.
 If, however, the view is currently animating, the value will be automatically
 advanced as soon as it is edited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio allows you to apply various filters to your images.
 These features are still under development, and as such there are not yet
 many filters available.
 In order to add, edit, or apply filters to your image, select the image
 from the Model Tree, then select the Filters tab in the 3D Image box in
 the Model panel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding, Removing, and Editing Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Filter GUI consists of two boxes, the Filters box and the Filter Properties
 box, and an Apply button.
 Due to the time-intensive nature of some filters, filters are only applied
 to the image when you click the Apply button.
 The effects of any addition, removal, editing, or reordering of filters
 will not be applied to the image until the Apply button is clicked.
 The following actions can be done in the Filter GUI:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To add a new filter, click the green plus icon to the right of the Filters
 box.
 This will open a dialog box which will allow you to select the type of
 filter you'd like to add.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To remove a filter, select it from the list of filters, and click the red
 X icon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To change the order in which filters are applied, simply drag and drop the
 filters in the Filters box to reorder them.
 The filters will be applied in order from top to bottom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To change a filter's properties, select the filter from the Filters box.
 The filter's properties will appear, and can be edited in the Filter Properties
 box.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Available Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image filtering functionality in FEBio Studio is new, and under active
 development.
 As such, there are only a small number of filters currently available.
 Many more filters will be added soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three filters currently available: a threshold filter, a mean
 image filter, and a Gaussian blur filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The threshold filter allows you to set a minimum and maximum intensity value
 for your image.
 Pixel values below your minimum will be set to 0, those above your maximum
 will be set to 255, and all other pixel values will be scaled between 0
 and 255 linearly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean image filter will assign each pixel the value of the average of
 all surrounding pixels within a given radius.
 The X, Y, and Z radii can each be set individually.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussian blur filter applies a Gaussian blur to the image.
 The sigma value of the Gaussian distribution can be specified in the filter
 properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any other filters that may appear should be considered experimental for
 now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Other 3D Image Visualization Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a 3D image stack is loaded you can attach several image renderers
 to visualize the image data in the Graphics View.
 Before you add an image renderer, make sure the correct image stack is
 selected in the Model Viewer.
 In the following section, the different image renderers are described.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

TETGEN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
File format used by the TetGen software.
 TetGen typically splits the mesh into two separate files, a .node file,
 which contains the nodal coordinates and .ele file, which contains the element
 connectivity.
 The TetGen file reader expects the .ele file and will automatically look
 for a .node file that has the same file name.
 So, for example, if the .ele file is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mymesh.ele
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then the file reader will look for a .node file called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mymesh.node
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the same file folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
RAW
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RAW format is used to define a 3D stack of image data.
 The RAW file reader will import the image data and generate a hexahedral
 mesh that has the same number of elements in x, y, and z as the image dimension
s.
 The elements are partitioned based on the grayscale levels in the image.
 For instance, for a black-and-white image, two parts will be created, one
 for all the elements that correspond to the black part of the image, and
 one for all the elements that correspond to the white part of the image.
 
\end_layout
