              FEBIO STUDIO - RELEASE NOTES

*****************************************************************

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   3.0   1/5/2026

===========================================================================

FEBio Studio version 3.0 is a major update and contains a lot of new features and changes. The two main design goals were to make working with FBS more programmable and to provide more tools for debugging FEBio runs. 
The following is a short summary of the most noteworthy changes in FBS3. Please see the FEBio Studio User Manual for more details. 
* The FEBio Monitor allows users to run FEBio models interactively from the graphical user interface. The model's state can be inspected visually at any time during the solution process. 
* FEBio Reports provide a comprehensive analysis of the FEBio job. FEBio Reports can also be generated from FEBio log files, though they may be less detailed than reports generated from FEBio jobs that are run inside FEBio Studio. 
* FEBio Studio now supports Python. A simple Python editor is available within FBS and the built-in Pyhton interpreter (using Pyhton 3.13.1) can run custom Python scripts. (An external Pyhon module is in development and will be available in the next release.)
* Users can now generate FEBio plugins entirely from the FEBio Studio interface. The plugin files are generated via a wizard. They can then be edited within FBS3 and build into a plugin. 
* The new Plugin Repository provides access to FEBio plugins developed by others. Using the Plugin Repo, users can quickly find plugins and install them in their local installation. 
* FEBio Studio's render engine has been completely overhauled and now uses a hardware abstraction layer. This means that the user can now choose what render backend to use on their system. For instance, mac users can now use Metal. Other supported backends are OpenGL (all OS), Direct3D 11/12 (Windows), and Vulkan (Windows and Linux).

In addition, FBS3 now uses the .fsm extension again as the default extension for FEBio Studio models. (It can still read .fs2 files and some other older formats.)
The FBS3 settings are now stored in a different location than FBS2 so FBS3 will not import the FBS2 settings. The settings are now stored in an INI file and, in principle, can be hand-edited although this is not recommended.

The following lists changes in addition to the new features listed above.

New Features:
* A ray-tracer was implemented that allows users to generate high-quality, arbitrary resolution images of their models and results. The ray-tracer will also produce better results when shadows or transparency is required. 
* Instead of simply using colors for materials and objects, users can now customize all the visual material properties that are used to rendered the model (on build and post side). 
* Environment maps can be configured to enable special reflection effects.

* Modified ICP Registration tool so it works with different type of selections.
* Modified how signed distance is calculated in distance map. Users can now choose the convention for calculating signed distances. 
* Added support for exporting higher order elements to stl and surf. (Higher-order elements are triangulated before export.)
* Renamed "invert" math function filter to "negate" (#196)
* Added filename to RAW image import dialog. (#184)

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   2.0   1/5/2023

===========================================================================

* This release is a major overhaul of the code. One of the main goals was a better integration with FEBio. The results of this integration are: 
 - New features in FEBio will be automatically available in FEBio Studio and FEBio Studio now supports FEBio features that previously were not available (e.g. advanced load controllers, mesh adaptors, mesh data, linear constraints, and more). 
 - FEBio Studio can read FEBio plugins, so plugin developers can now setup their models directly within the UI. 
 - Improved consistency between febio input file structure and febio studio model tree. 

* Note that FEBio Studio 2 uses a different extension (*.fs2). Since FEBio Studio 2 can be installed alongside FEBio Studio 1, we opted to change the extension so that it is easier to distinguish new files from older files. FEBio Studio 2 continues to read the older fsm files.

* This version addresses several issues with the auto-updater. As a result, this version cannot be installed through the auto-updater, but requires a fresh installation of FEBio Studio. After installing this new version, users will be able to continue using the auto-updater to update FEBio Studio to the latest version. 
* This new version also comes with an updated EULA (EULA version 4) that includes a new PRIVACY clause. This was added because FEBio Studio communicates with an external server in order to provide services such as the model repo and the auto-updater. As of this version, a universally unique identifier is also assigned to each installation of FEBio Studio and send to the external server. This UUID is used to accumulate basic statistics on FEBio Studio usage. No personal data is send, recorded, or shared by FEBio Studio or FEBio.

===========================================================================

* Warnings are now reported when invalid surface facets are detected while reading FEBio input file.
* Fixed crash when multiphasic material with solute/sbm is created before solutes/sbm are defined. 
* Modified STL reader so format is detected automatically. Users no longer need to specify whether the file is in ascii or binary format. 
* A bug was fixed in the Decimation tool.
* Objects can now be copied between models (via Edit\Copy object abd Edit\Paste object). 
* The Welcome page is now a separate tab. It can be closed and reopened via Help\Show Welcome Page. 
* Document tabs now show icons. 
* Fixed bug that was adding the "preview" palette each time a new model was created. 
* Fixed the Kinemat tool. 
* Several issues were fixed related to working on multiple models simultaneously. 
* An issue was fixed with rendering edges that have no nodes. 
* When reading feb files, the names of loads are retained. 
* Added density and k (bulk modulus) parameter to uncoupled prestrain material. This was preventing this material from being read in properly. 
* A bug was fixed with processing fiber property in feb files. 
* Fixed issues with rendering shells as hexes. 
* A bug was fixed that was not initializing edges correctly when reading the fsm files. 
* An issue was fixed with region-selecting nodes and faces when "select backfacing" and "ignore interior" options were set. 
* The algorithm parameters behind the "Scalar field" and "Fiber generator" tools can now be set. 
* In the Fiber generator tool, you can now specify for which material you want to apply the tool to.
* An issue was fixed with fsm files not closing properly after they are loaded. 
* A few issues were fixed with the Transform tool, when all transorm properties were set simultaneously. 
* A minor bug was fixed in the project upload wizard on the repo panel. 
* The prestrain constraint class is now available from the Constraints menu.

 R E L E A S E   1.1   11/2/2020
 
===========================================================================

* The FEBio 3.0 format is now the default format used when running FEBio models from within FEBio Studio. (Users can still select other formats.)
* Support was added for reading tied-facet-to-facet contact in febio2 files. 
* Abaqus export feature was added. This feature currently only supports writing the model as a single part, and only outputs nodes and elements. It only exports linear and quadratic solid elements. 
* A bug was fixed in febio3 file reader when MeshDomains section is empty. 
* Fixed an issue when using FEBioStudio on multiple monitors that have different dpi settings.
* A bug was fixed when a user tries to assign a mesh selection from another mesh that the model component was already assigned to. 
* A bug was fixed when rendering color gradients on discrete elements. 
* An issue was fixed when reloading plot files while graphs were open. This led sometimes to FEBio Studio crashing. 
* Several issues with visualizing 3D image data in post mode were fixed. 
* A context menu option was added to the model tree to allow the user to delete all discrete elements. 
* For colormaps and tensor plots the min/max range options can be set independently. 
* A couple bugs were fixed related to importing and exporting rigid constraints to febio3 format. 
* Support for xplt format 3 was added, which writes rigid bodies and rigid constraints to plot file. 
* An option was added to set a limit to the path length of a particle flow plot. 
* The PRLig material was moved to the "elastic" category (it was incorrectly listed under the "uncoupled elastic" category). 
* The Scalar Field tool can now be used to generate element data, which can then be assigned to a material parameter. 
* The selection box now supports collapsed view, which is the default for mesh item lists.
* A feature was added to grow and shrink selections. Use menu "Edit\More Selection Options\Grow (Shrink) Selection", or the corresponding shortcut keys. 
* An issue with the layout spacing of the description on the repo panel was fixed. 
* An option was added to the Abaqus importer to ignore the solid sections. 
* A few feature was added that allows a part selection to be converted to the corresponding element selection. 
* The febio3 exporter now writes named element selections. 
* Local repo file structure will now mimic file structure on repo panel. 
* A bug was fixed that was causing a segmentation fault when users tried to edit vec2i parameters. 
* Some issues were fixed reading MeshData section from febio 2.5 and 3.0 files.
* Added support for the "smooth_aug" parameter to the sliding-biphasic contact.
* Some issues were fixed with "target" rigid forces. 
* The "show material fiber" options is now stored in settings file. 
* The option to show fibers on hidden parts was expanded to include hidden elements. 
* Default material fiber orientation was changed to be consistent with FEBio. 
* The model tree now shows the type string next to each item. 
* An issue was fixed with processing mesh edges that was causing slow performance for models with a large number of edges. 
* The timeline panel was added which shows a time line of the states in the post model. 
* Support was added fir defining load curves for contact parameters (fixes issue #14). 
* A fix was added when reading febio2 files that converts the old "theta" and "phi" parameters of some fiber materials to the new format. 
* New materials were added: reactive plasticity, reactive plastic damage, DC octahedral shear streain. 
* Ported the old PostView save options to FEBio Studio. 
* Users can now set displacement scale factor for x,y,z independently. 
* The scale filter applied to vector fields now allows users to set the scale factor for x,y,z independently.

 R E L E A S E   1.0.3   10/7/2020
 
===========================================================================

* A bug was fixed that was causing some material parameters in a solid mixture (and other nested materials) to be reset when making edits in the material properties list.

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.0.2   10/2/2020
 
===========================================================================

* A bug was fixed that was preventing febio 2.5 files that contained mesh data "generators" from being read in. These sections are still ignored, but will not prevent the rest of the file from being read in. 
* A bug was fixed in reading prescribed bcs of the febio 3.0 file format. 
* A bug was fixed in the project tree of the repo panel and upload wizard related to how the folders are organized.
