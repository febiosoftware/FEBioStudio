* Mesh data maps can now be created and edited from within the UI. To add a new mesh data map, right-click on the MeshData item in the model tree and click Add. After adding a map, right-click on the map in the model tree and click Edit to edit the map. The map values can be edited directly or copy/pasted via the clipboard.

 R E L E A S E   2.0   1/5/2023

===========================================================================

* This release is a major overhaul of the code. One of the main goals was a better integration with FEBio. The results of this integration are: 
 - New features in FEBio will be automatically available in FEBio Studio and FEBio Studio now supports FEBio features that previously were not available (e.g. advanced load controllers, mesh adaptors, mesh data, linear constraints, and more). 
 - FEBio Studio can read FEBio plugins, so plugin developers can now setup their models directly within the UI. 
 - Improved consistency between febio input file structure and febio studio model tree. 

* Note that FEBio Studio 2 uses a different extension (*.fs2). Since FEBio Studio 2 can be installed alongside FEBio Studio 1, we opted to change the extension so that it is easier to distinguish new files from older files. FEBio Studio 2 continues to read the older fsm files. 

* This version also has several new 3D image processing capabilities.
 - Support for reading 3d images in several formats, including DICOM, TIFF, OME TIFF, RAW. 
 - A basic image filtering pipeline was implemented. 
 - A tool was added that can interpolate an image onto a mesh and generate mesh data. The mesh data can then be assigned to material parameters. 
 - Improved volume rendering capabilities. 

* Added new dialog for reporting bugs. (menu Help\Submit a bug report)

 R E L E A S E   1.5   5/17/2021

===========================================================================

* This version addresses several issues with the auto-updater. As a result, this version cannot be installed through the auto-updater, but requires a fresh installation of FEBio Studio. After installing this new version, users will be able to continue using the auto-updater to update FEBio Studio to the latest version. 
* This new version also comes with an updated EULA (EULA version 4) that includes a new PRIVACY clause. This was added because FEBio Studio communicates with an external server in order to provide services such as the model repo and the auto-updater. As of this version, a universally unique identifier is also assigned to each installation of FEBio Studio and send to the external server. This UUID is used to accumulate basic statistics on FEBio Studio usage. No personal data is send, recorded, or shared by FEBio Studio or FEBio.
* This version uses a new version of Qt (version 6). CMakeLists have been updated to work more smoothly with both Qt5 and Qt6.

* A mesh inflation modifier was implemented that adds a layer of structured elements, while preserving the underlying mesh topology.
* The underlying multi-block mesh generator that many of the primitives use has been significantly improved. For most of the primitives the resulting mesh is not altered, however, the cylinder now produces a slightly different mesh, compared to the previous version. 
* The dogbone primitive uses a different meshing algorithm that does not have the mesh singularity in the curved section. It was noticed that the singularity could create artifacts in the results. In addition, mesh-zoning parameters were added for this primitive. 
* A cylindrical matertial axes generation option was added to the "Set Axes" tool. 
* The fiber generator tool can now also be used to generate material axes. This works by assigning the generated fiber to the local "x" axis, and then generating an orthogonal coordinate system. For shells, the local "z" axis will be aligned with the shell normal. 
* A bug that could crash FEBio Studio was fixed in the "Axes from Curvature" tool.
* The Convert tool on the Mesh panel will now only show available options for the active mesh.
* Support was added for exporting DataArray variables (with DATA_ITEM format).
