\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio is an integrated environment for the finite element modeling
 program FEBio.
 Although it has some mesh generation capabilities, its primary function
 is to set up the boundary and loading conditions, material properties,
 and analysis parameters for finite element analysis with the software FEBio.
 The main features of FEBio Studio include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User-friendly UI that greatly facilitates the FE modeling process 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Primitive mesh generation, e.g.
 boxes, cylinders, spheres, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tetrahedral mesh generation and remeshing via TetGen, NetGen, and MMG 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mesh editing on element and sub-element level 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports various FE file formats, including FEBio, Abaqus, Ansys, Comsol,
 LSDYNA 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports various mesh file formats, including STL, VTK, BYU.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports most of FEBio's modeling capabilities, including boundary conditions,
 surface and body loads, contact interfaces, analysis types, and more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FE model can be exported to FEBio and NIKE3D file formats.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mesh can also be exported to various file formats, including LSDYNA, VTK,
 and more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FEBio model can be run from within the GUI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FEBio plot files, which contain the analysis results, can be visualized
 directly in FEBioStudio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has been designed to create FEBio input files.
 Although it can create input files for other FE programs (like NIKE3D),
 this document assumes that FEBio will be used as the finite element solver.
 It is important to keep this in mind, since other programs may not support
 all the features of FEBio.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this step we will show you the most important skills you need to navigate
 the Graphics View, namely rotating the view, zooming, panning, and selecting
 and transforming objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rotate the view, click anywhere in an open area of the graphics view
 with the left mouse button and hold it down.
 By dragging the mouse left and right you can rotate the view to the left
 or to the right.
 Similarly, by dragging the mouse up and down you rotate the model up and
 down.
 Panning works similarly as rotating, except you use the middle mouse button
 instead of the left.
 Hold down the middle mouse button and drag the mouse to pan the view.
 You can zoom in or out by holding down the right mouse button.
 Drag the mouse up to zoom in and move it down to zoom out.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 for an overview of the different methods of changing the view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selecting objects
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel4"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selection is another important aspect for interacting with the model.
 Selection requires a selection context, which tells FEBioStudio what type
 of entity you would like to select.
 The current selection context is highlighted on the toolbar and can be
 changed by clicking on the corresponding selection button.
 For instance, to select an object, first click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Select Object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button on the main toolbar (i.e.
 the button with the green ball).
 With the button selected, you can now select any object in the model by
 clicking on it with the left mouse button.
 Selecting another object will automatically unselect the first selected
 object.
 To add an object to the current selection, hold down the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key
\emph default
 when you select the object.
 Similarly, you can remove an object from the current selection by holding
 down the 
\emph on
ctrl key 
\emph default
when clicking on the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To select several objects with one motion, first choose a selection method
 from the main toolbar.
 There are three selection methods: rectangle, circle, and free form.
 For example, select the rectangle selection method.
 Now, hold down the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
 and then click and hold down the left mouse button on an empty part of
 the screen.
 With the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key 
\emph default
and left mouse button down, drag the mouse to draw a rectangle around the
 objects you wish the select.
 Once you let go of the left mouse button, all objects that are inside or
 intersect the rectangle will be selected.
 You can also use this procedure to unselect several objects at once.
 Just repeat the procedure but hold down the 
\emph on
ctrl key
\emph default
 instead of the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
.
 The other selection methods work similarly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transforming an object
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel5"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an object is selected you can transform it, which means you can translate,
 rotate, or scale it.
 To apply a particular transformation, make sure one of more objects are
 selected.
 Then click on one of the transform buttons on the toolbar.
 For example, to translate an object click on the translate toolbar button
 (i.e.
 the button with the crossed arrows).
 A triad appears on the selected object(s).
 The triad is positioned at the current pivot point, which is the center
 from which the transformation is applied.
 The triad consists of three colored arms and three colored planes.
 When you move the mouse over one of the arms or planes, it becomes highlighted.
 A highlighted arm or plane can be selected and when you drag the mouse,
 you can move the object in the corresponding direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more precise modeling you can also enter the transformation numerically
 using the 
\emph on
Transform 
\emph default
dialog which is accessible from the 
\emph on

\emph default
menu (

 Note that you have a virtually unlimited undo-redo stack so you rarely
 have to worry about making mistakes.
 However, for large models the undo stack may consume a lot of memory.
 The undo stack is cleared each time you save your model.

, or by clicking the corresponding icon on the main toolbar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Run FEBio dialog box will appear.
 When clicking the Run button, FEBio Studio will write the FEBio model input
 file (usually, this file will have the job's name with the .feb file extension)
 and then start FEBio, passing the input file to it.
 FEBio itself is a command line program that will now run in the background.
 The output generated by FEBio is displayed on the Log panel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When FEBio is done, the results are stored in a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When running an FEBio model, a new item is added to the model tree.
 This item will appear under Jobs and has the job's name.
 When the model is running in FEBio, this item will show some progress and
 status information.
 After the run is completed, the results can be loaded via this item.

When running a model in FEBio, a new item is added to the model tree with
 the job's name.
 When FEBio completed you can open the results by double-clicking the item
 in the model tree.
 This will load the job's plot file and open it in FEBio Studio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you open a plot file in FEBio Studio you will notice that the UI changes.
 The Model and Build panels will dissapear and the Post panel will appear.
 The Build toolbar is also replaced by the Post toolbar.
 The Post panel has somewhat the same purpose as the Model panel and displays
 a tree structure of the contents of the plot file.
 It also contains some additional tabs that provide additional information
 on the results and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Graphics View shows a 3D view of the current model.
 The user can adjust the view in several ways.
 The fastest way of maneuvering through the view is by using the mouse.
 The different mouse buttons invoke different commands depending on the
 current 
\emph on
mode 
\emph default
of the Graphics View.
 There are four buttons on the Toolbar that control this mode, namely the
 
\emph on
select
\emph default
, 
\emph on
move
\emph default
, 
\emph on
rotate 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
scale 
\emph default
buttons.
 The current mode is indicated by the button that is highlighted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the Graphics view mode, the view can be rotated by dragging
 the mouse button outside any geometry while holding down the left mouse
 button.
 A similar action but with the right mouse button down allows the user to
 zoom the view.
 The user can pan the current view by holding down the middle mouse button.
 Objects and items can be selected in all four Graphics view modes.
 To select an object or item (e.g.
 part, surface, edge), bring the mouse cursor over the object or item, and
 click on it with the left mouse button.
 To add objects or items to the current selection, hold down the shift button
 while clicking on the object or item.
 To add several objects or items, drag the mouse while holding down the
 shift button and left mouse button.
 To deselect objects or items, the same operations can be performed, only
 this time, hold down the ctrl button instead of the shift button.
 To deselect all objects or items at once, click in an empty area of the
 Graphics View.
 There are also several menu items that allow you to modify the current
 selection.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, FEBio Studio renders the model using 
\emph on
perspective projection
\emph default
 in the Graphics View.
 By right-clicking with the mouse button a popup menu shows up under the
 cursor that allows the user to toggle between perspective and orthographic
 projection.
 In addition, this menu provides some buttons that allows the user to quickly
 orient the geometry along one of the three coordinate axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Graphics View is in one of three transform modes (move, rotate
 or scale) a triad will appear in the center of the selection.
 When moving the mouse over the triad, one of its arms may highlight, indicating
 that this arm can be selected.
 To apply a transformation to the current selection, bring the mouse cursor
 over one of the triad arms so that it highlights.
 Next, drag the mouse button while holding down the left mouse button.
 Releasing the left mouse button will let go of the arm and finish the transform
ation.

\emph on
Tools/Curve Editor 
\emph default
menu or by pressing the corresponding button on the toolbar.
 It can also be accessed using the 
\emph on
F4 
\emph default
shortcut.
 The 
\emph on
Curve Editor 
\emph default
gives an overview of all the time-dependent parameters in the model.
 FEBioStudio allows the user to define the time dependency explicitly through
 the use of so-called 
\emph on
load curves
\emph default
.
 A load curve is simply an interpolated function of (time, value) pairs.
 The value will have a meaning that depends on the parameter associated
 with the curve.
 For example, if the load curve describes a nodal displacement, the value
 of the curve is the actual displacement and has the length units used in
 the design of the geometry.
 If the load curve describes a material parameter, then the value is the
 time evolution of that parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that many features that allow you to define a load
 curve also allow you to define a scale factor.
 In that case, the actual value of the parameter is the scale factor multiplied
 with the load curve value.
 For example, when prescribing the displacement, the scale factor is defined
 in the properties dialog when creating the prescribed constraint.
 The scale factor is not taken into account in the Curve Editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the top of the curve editor's overview panel, the selection filter can
 be found.
 This filter allows you to show the load curves of only a specific type
 of model component, e.g.
 boundary conditions, material parameters, etc.
 This filter can be helpful in finding a specific parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most load curves have a default linear shape that ramps up the value from
 zero to one.
 However, all curves can be modified using the tools available at the bottom
 of the Curve Editor.
 The curve's data points are represented as dots on the view.
 These data points can be selected by clicking on them with the left mouse
 button.
 They can also be moved by click
\begin_inset Formula $+$

dragging them.

Instead of creating geometry directly in FEBioStudio it is more common to
 create your geometry in dedicated software and import the mesh into FEBioStudio.
 FEBioStudio can import several different mesh file formats.
 Geometry can be imported using the 
\emph on

menu.
 Appendix A lists an overview of all the supported file formats including
 the supported features of the particular formats.

 parameters and editing options.
 For primitives this shows the same parameters as when the object was created.
 This allows you to change the object's dimensions at any time.
 If the object is not a primitive, no options will be shown here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other feature to note at the top of both the Edit and Mesh panels is
 the Object rollout.
 This shows the name of the active object as well as its type.
 An object can be converted to a different type via the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meshing Primitives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the object is a primitive, that is, created with one of the geometry
 creation tools, the command window will list the mesh creation parameters
 for that particular object.
 Most primitives will be meshed with a so-called 
\emph on
butterfly mesh
\emph default
.
 These primitives have a simple rectangular box as center.
 The rest of the mesh is a projection from this box to the respective geometry.
 For instance, for the sphere the surface of the inner box is projected
 onto a sphere.
 This projection is segmented to create several layers of elements.
 Note that all solid primitives are composed of 8-noded hexahedral elements
 and all shell primitives are composed of 4-noded quadrilateral elements.
 After you changed the mesh parameters simply press the 
\emph on
Apply 
\emph default
button to create the new mesh.
 To show the mesh in the Graphics View select the

Editable Meshes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the object is a so-called 
\emph on
editable mesh 
\emph default
the Mesh panel will list some mesh editing tools.
 Editable meshes don't have a geometry object associated with it so the
 mesh, or at least its surface, defines the geometry implicitly.
 This has some important consequences related to applying boundary conditions
 to an editable mesh.
 Any change to the mesh may also change the corresponding geometry and as
 a consequence any data that was associated with the previous geometry may
 become invalid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Important Note.

After you selected the step and the type of boundary condition, simply press

\begin_layout Standard
In general, there are two types of boundary conditions.
 There are the 
\emph on
fixed constraints 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
prescribed constraints
\emph default
.
 For a fixed constraint, the corresponding degree of freedom is kept zero
 throughout the entire analysis.
 For a prescribed constraint, the value of the corresponding degree of freedom
 is defined through a load curve.
 You may wonder why the fixed constraints are available, since you can achieve
 the same result by defining a zero load curve for a prescribed constraint.
 The reason is that the degrees of freedom for fixed constraints are removed
 from the linear system of equations, reducing the computational time to
 solve the linear system.
 On the other hand, since the equations are removed, no reaction loads are
 calculated for fixed constraints.
 If you need to know for instance the reaction force on a boundary, you
 need to use a prescribed displacement even if the displacement is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand that with each prescribed constraint a load
 curve is associated.
 The actual value for the constraint at any given time is the product of
 the scale factor which you will enter in the properties dialog for the
 boundary condition and the value of the load curve at that time.
 Since by default the load curve will ramp from zero to one, the constraint
 value will ramp from zero to the specified value in a linear way.
 If you wish to modify the default curve you can edit it in the Curve Editor.

 One for the front-face of the shell, and one for the back face.
 The usual displacement degrees of freedom are used for the front-face of
 the shell, and the shell displacement degrees of freedom are used for the

\begin_layout Standard
The pressure load allows you to apply a pressure follower force to a surface.
 These pressure forces are always directed along the local surface normal
 and therefore change when the object undergoes a large deformation.
 Also note that, like prescribed constraints, a load curve is associated
 with the pressure force which by default will ramp the pressure value from

The degrees of freedom of rigid bodies can be constrained in the same way
 as any other degree of freedom in the model.
 Before you can apply a constraint to a rigid body, you need to define a
 rigid body.
 In FEBioStudio, rigid bodies are implicitly defined when you create a rigid
 body material.
 A rigid body constraint can now be applied using the 
\emph on

 It is important to note that when a rigid body is created none of its degrees
 of freedom are initially constrained.

In FEBio, contact constraints are enforced using an

 This implies that the Lagrange multipliers are only approximated to a user-spec
ified tolerance.
 The following parameters will appear in nearly all contact interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Penalty factor: 
\series default
The penalty factor controls the rate of convergence.
 A high penalty factor will try to reach the tolerance quickly, but if chosen
 too high might introduce instability into the system.
 If it is too low, convergence to within the specified tolerance might not
 be reached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sliding interfaces, there will usually be an option for 
\emph on
two-pass
\emph default
 option.
 In a usual contact implementation, the required integrations are only performed
 over one of the surfaces, usually referred to as the 
\emph on
slave 
\emph default
surface.
 If the contacting surfaces are perfectly smooth, it does not matter which
 surface acts as the slave or master surface.
 However, in an FE simulation the surfaces are discretized and are most
 likely non-conforming.
 Thus, the choice of master and slave surfaces is important and will introduce
 bias in the solution.
 It is usually advisable to select the more finely meshed surface as the
 slave.
 In the 
\emph on
two pass algorithm
\emph default
, an attempt is made to reduce the bias by performing the contact calculations
 twice, with the roles of slave and master surface switched for the second
 pass.
 Although it may appear that the two pass algorithm is always the best choice,
 this is not always so.
 Certain contact applications perform better using a single pass.
 See the 
\emph on
FEBio Theory Manual 
\emph default
for a more detailed description of the contact model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the contact parameters are entered the user needs to define the 
\emph on
master 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
slave 
\emph default
surfaces.
 To do this, first close the contact interface dialog and select the contact
 interface in the Model Editor.
 In the Model Editor you will now notice two selection boxes, one for the
 master surface and one for the slave surface.
 The boxes work similarly as for boundary conditions.
 For instance, to add a surface of your model to the master surface, select
 the surface in the Graphics View and press the '
\begin_inset Formula $+$

' button in the master's surface selection box.

 By

, we mean that the nodes comprising the mesh of the deformable object do
 not mate directly to the nodes comprising the rigid body at the interface.
 In other words, no nodes are shared between the two objects.
 The rigid interface requires only one parameter: the rigid material that
 defines the rigid body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
A rigid wall
\series default
 interface is similar to a sliding interface except that the master surface
 is a rigid plane.
 The geometry of the plane is simplified since the master surface is implicitly

 explicitly.
 The plane can also be assigned a prescribed displacement in the Curve Editor.
 Just look for the name of the rigid wall and edit the 
\emph on

\emph default
curve.
 In this case the plane equation generalizes to:

A sliding interface defines a non-penetration constraint between two surfaces.
 This means that the surfaces are allowed to separate and slide across each

 If the contacting parts are biphasic or multiphasic, specialized contact
 interfaces can be used to allow fluid or solvent to flow across the contact
 interface when the parts are in contact.
 The following sliding interfaces are available.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several types of launch configurations, each with a different
 set of fields to edit.
 With the exception of the 
\emph on
Local
\emph default
 launch configuration type, all types run your jobs on a remote server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Local
\emph default
 launch configuration type will launch the specified FEBio executable to
 run your job.
 This will be run on your current machine.
 The only field required is:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
FEBio Executable
\emph default
: The path to the local FEBio executable that you wish to run with this
 configuration
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 launch configuration type will copy your job files to a remote server via
 SFTP into the specified directory, and then run the job via SSH with the
 specified remote FEBio executable.
 To use a remote configuration, fill out the following fields:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
: The remote path to the FEBio executable that you wish to run with this
 configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Server
\emph default
: The domain name or IP address of the server that you wish to connect to
 via SSH/SFTP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Port
\emph default
: The port on your server on which the SSH service is being hosted.
 By default, this is set to 22, which is the standard port for the SSH protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Username
\emph default
: Your username on the remote machine.
 Your user account must have permissions to connect to the server via SSH.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remote Directory
\emph default
: The remote directory to which your FEBio input file will be copied, and
 which will act as the working directory for your FEBio run.
 Unless otherwise specifed in your input file, your log and plot files will
 be created here.
 This directory need not exist, and will be created automatically if it
 does not.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
PBS Queue
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
SLURM Queue
\emph default
 launch configuration types will copy your job files to a remote server
 via SFTP into the specified directory, and then add a new job to a PBS
 or SLURM queuing system.
 These launch configuration types each have all of the same fields as the
 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 type, along with a text box in which a PBS or SLURM script may be edited.
 At launch, the contents of this text box are put into a file, transfered
 via SFTP to the remote server, and run with either the 
\emph on
qsub
\emph default
 (for PBS) or the 
\emph on
sbatch
\emph default
 (for SLURM) command.
 By default, the text box contains a valid PBS or SLURM script with some
 common options set.
 For convenience, several macros have been defined, which you may use in
 your script.
 Before being written to a file and being copied to the server, these macros
 are replaced with a string unique to either the launch configuration, or
 the current job.
 These macros are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${JOB_NAME}
\emph default
: This macro will be replaced with the name of the current job as defined
 in the 
\emph on
Run FEBio
\emph default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${REMOTE_DIR}
\emph default
: This macro will be replaced with the contents of the 
\emph on
Remote Directory
\emph default
 field in the launch configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${FEBIO_PATH}
\emph default
: This macro will be replaced with the contents of the 
\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
 field in the launch configuratoin.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Custom Remote
\emph default
 launch configuration type will copy your job files to a remote server via
 SFTP into the specified directory, and then run a set of specified commands
 in series on the remote server via SSH.
 This launch configuration type has all of the same fields as the 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 type, except for the 
\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
 field.
 It also has a text box in which a custom series of commands may be written,
 one on each line.
 There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a custom script:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The same macros available in the 
\emph on
PBS Queue
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
SLURM Queue
\emph default
 launch configuration types are available for use in this script, with the
 exception of the 
\emph on
${FEBIO_PATH}
\emph default
 macro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lines starting with the '#' symbol are comments and will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Emtpy lines are ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The full string of each line will be run as a separate command on the remote
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The script written in this field is not a bash script, but rather a set
 of discrete commands which will be executed in series.
 It is of course possible to run a bash script with this launch configuration
 type, by placing the desired script on the remote server, and then running
 the script by calling it in one of the lines of the text box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This launch configuration type allows for great flexability.
 Using it, you can do pre and post processing of your FEBio jobs on a remote
 server with the click of a single button.
 Use this launch configuration type with caution, as it does not have any
 safety nets; anything you tell the remote server to do, it will do, as
 long as your user account has permissions to do it.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When an FEBio job is started using any of the remote launch configuration
 types, an SSH connection is made to the remote server.
 This requires authentication.
 If you have set up private key authentication for the specified server
 and username, the authentication will happen automatically.
 Otherwise, you will be prompted for your user account password during the
 first attempt to connect to the server.
 This password will be encrypted and stored in RAM for the duration of your
 FEBio Studio session, and will automatically used for subsequent server
 interactions until you close FEBio Studio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to retrieve the log and plot files from any of the remote launch
 configuration types, click the 
\emph on
Get Remote Files
\emph default
 button under the 
\emph on
Job
\emph default
 properties in the 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 The status of the PBS or SLURM queue may be checked by clicking the 
\emph on
Get Queue Status
\emph default
 button under the 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Using FEBio Plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio supports plugins and the plugins are usually listed in the FEBio configura
tion file.
 If you wish the use plugins, you need to make a custom configuration file.
 See the FEBio User's Manual for details about defining plugins in the configura
tion file.
 Once you have your custom configuration file, you can enter that configuration
 file in the Advanced Settings in the Run FEBio dialog.

Recording an animation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has the capability to record an animation of the current GV.
 To record an animation, first position and resize the capture frame so
 that it covers the desired area of the GV that will be captured.
 Next, select the 
\emph on
Record/New 
\emph default
menu.
 This opens a standard file dialog box where you can select a file format
 and enter the target filename.
 If the selected file format is an image format (.bmp, .tiff, etc.), the target
 filename will be the file template from which the actual filenames will
 be generated.
 Each frame will be stored in a separate file, where the frame number is
 appended to the file template.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you have selected a target file, you are ready for recording.
 Note that the capture frame will now be locked, so you can no longer move
 or resize it.
 If it is visible, it will turn red.
 The recording will begin in a paused state, allowing you to make some changes
 to the GV before recording begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Start 
\emph default
from the menu or press the corresponding shortcut.
 Now, all the action in the GV will be recorded to the target file.
 For example, if you press the play button, the GV will loop over all timesteps
 and each step will be recorded to the file.
 You can also rotate the GV and this will also be recorded to the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To pause the recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Pause 
\emph default
from the menu.
 To finally stop the recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Stop 
\emph default
from the menu.
 This will close the target file and unlock the capture frame.

 of the model.
 The following properties are defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Element subdivisions: 
\emph default
defines the number of subdivision levels.
 FEBio Studio subdivides the elements in the model to improve the quality
 of the renderings.
 However, increasing the number of subdivisions will also increase the time
 it takes to render the model so use this property judiciously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render mode: 
\emph default
Sets the render mode to solid or wireframe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render smooth -
\emph default
 when selected 
\emph on
yes
\emph default
, FEBio Studio will render the model smoothly.
 This means that it will vary the surface normal of the model to create
 a smooth surface.
 When selected 
\emph on
no
\emph default
, flat shading is used to render the model.
 Note that smooth shading can be significantly slower than flat shading
 due to the additional calculations that FEBio Studio needs to do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shells as hexes -
\emph default
 renders all shells as hexahedral elements using the shell thickness (if
 available) to extrude the shell surface in the normal direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shell reference surface -
\emph default
 defines how FEBio Studio needs to interpret the shell surface in relation
 to the shell volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Smoothing angle -
\emph default
 identifies the hard edges in the model.
 Edges with adjoining faces that have a surface normal, whose angle is more
 than the smoothing angle, are considered hard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Displacement Map
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\emph default
sets the displacement scale factor, which can be used to scale the displacements
 when displaying the model in the Graphics View.
 (This scale factor does affect strain measures.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you must enable the displacement map by clicking on the 
\emph on
enable 
\emph default
button in the Model Viewer (this is the button with the checkmark).

 The properties will then be listed in the Properties Window below.
 The following properties are defined for the color map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Data field - 
\emph default
allows the user to select the data field that FEBio Studio will use to define
 the color of the model.
 The color of the model is defined by the data field and the color gradient
 (see below).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Gradient smoothing -
\emph default
 Colors the material by drawing a fringe plot of the selected data field.
 When gradient smoothing is on, the fringe colors are smoothed to produce
 a continuous transition between fringes.
 When this option is off, a discrete set of colors is used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
defines the color map that will be used to color the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Nodal values -
\emph default
 FEBio Studio defines nodal data and element data.
 When displaying element data, the element data is projected to the nodes
 to produce a smooth rendering of the data.
 However, when this option is turned of, element data will be displayed
 by using a single color for each element.
 This will produce a discretized drawing of the data, but will be truer
 to the actual data since the element data is not interpolated before displaying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Range type -
\emph default
 FEBio Studio keeps track of the range of the selected data field (that
 is the minimum and maximum values).
 The user can use this option to select a

Visualizing 3D Image Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has several capabilities for rendering and overlaying 3D image
 data.
 In order to visualize a 3D image, you must first load a 3D image stack
 into the active model.
 Then, you need to attach one of the 3D image rendering tools to the image
 stack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Loading 3D image data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, only RAW image data is supported.
 To load image data, select the File

Import Image menu, which will show the standard File Open dialog box.
 In the filter selection, select the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Raw image data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option.
 Then, locate the image file on the file system and click OK.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, a dialog box will appear where you can enter the dimensions of the
 image, as well as the physical range that corresponds to the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the image data will be loaded into the active model, unless
 no model has been loaded yet.
 In that case, the image will be loaded in a new and empty model.
 Thus, if you wish to view the image on top of a FE model, you first need
 to load that model, make sure it is active one, and then load the image
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After loading the image data, a new item appears in the Model Viewer.
 When selected, you can modify the physical range of the image.
 In addition, two tabs will appear next to the Properties tab, namely 
\emph on
Image Viewer 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
Histogram
\emph default
.
 With the Image Viewer you can scroll through the image slices of the 3D
 image stack.
 The Histogram shows the histogram of the image stack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Visualizing 3D Image Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a 3D image stack is loaded you can attach several image renderers
 to visualize the image data in the Graphics View.
 Before you add an image renderer, make sure the correct image stack is
 selected in the Model Viewer.
 In the following section, the different image renderers are described.
