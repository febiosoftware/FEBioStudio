// The GMeshObject defines the geometry of a "naked" FE mesh. That is, a mesh
// that does not correspond to a geometry object. There are two ways to create
// GMeshObjects. The first is to import a FE model from a file. Most FE models imported 
// are considered naked. The second is by converting a geometry object that has a mesh
// to a GMeshObject. 
// 
// This object defines the geometry (such as parts, faces, 
// edges, nodes) using this FE geometry. This has one major limitation and that
// is that when the user changes the mesh, it can not be assumed that the geometry
// stays the same and therefore all geometry dependant quantities (e.g. boundary 
// conditions) need to be removed. The GMeshObject is the only object for which
// the user can define their own partitions.
