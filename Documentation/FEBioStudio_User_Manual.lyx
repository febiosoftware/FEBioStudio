To rotate the view,
 click anywhere in an open area of the graphics view with the left mouse button and hold it down.
 By dragging the mouse left and right you can rotate the view to the left or to the right.
 Similarly,
 by dragging the mouse up and down you rotate the model up and down.
 Panning works similarly as rotating,
 except you use the middle mouse button instead of the left.
 Hold down the middle mouse button and drag the mouse to pan the view.
 You can zoom in or out by holding down the right mouse button.
 Drag the mouse up to zoom in and move it down to zoom out.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selecting objects
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel4"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selection is another important aspect for interacting with the model.
 Selection requires a selection context,
 which tells FEBioStudio what type of entity you would like to select.
 The current selection context is highlighted on the main toolbar and can be changed by clicking on the corresponding selection button.
 For instance,
 to select an object,
 first click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Select Object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button on the main toolbar (i.e.
 the button with the green ball).
 With the button selected,
 you can now select any object in the model by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
 Selecting another object will automatically unselect the first selected object.
 To add an object to the current selection,
 hold down the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key
\emph default
 when you select the object.
 Similarly,
 you can remove an object from the current selection by holding down the 
\emph on
ctrl key 
\emph default
when clicking on the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To select several objects with one motion,
 first choose a selection method from the main toolbar.
 There are three selection methods:
 rectangle,
 circle,
 and free form.
 For example,
 select the rectangle selection method.
 Now,
 hold down the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
 and then click and hold down the left mouse button on an empty part of the screen.
 With the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key 
\emph default
and left mouse button down,
 drag the mouse to draw a rectangle around the objects you wish the select.
 Once you let go of the left mouse button,
 all objects that are inside or intersect the rectangle will be selected.
 You can also use this procedure to unselect several objects at once.
 Just repeat the procedure but hold down the 
\emph on
ctrl key
\emph default
 instead of the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
.
 The other selection methods work similarly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transforming an object
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel5"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an object is selected you can transform it,
 which means you can translate,
 rotate,
 or scale it.
 To apply a particular transformation,
 make sure one of more objects are selected.
 Then click on one of the transform buttons on the toolbar.
 For example,
 to translate an object click on the translate toolbar button (i.e.
 the button with the crossed arrows).
 A triad appears on the selected object(s).
 The triad is positioned at the current pivot point,
 which is the center from which the transformation is applied.
 The triad consists of three colored arms and three colored planes.
 When you move the mouse over one of the arms or planes,
 it becomes highlighted.
 A highlighted arm or plane can be selected and when you drag the mouse,
 you can move the object in the corresponding direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more precise modeling you can also enter the transformation numerically using the 
\emph on
Transform 
\emph default
dialog which is accessible from the 
\emph on

 or by clicking the corresponding icon on the main toolbar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Run FEBio dialog box will appear.
 When clicking the Run button,
 FEBio Studio will write the FEBio model input file (usually,
 this file will have the job's name with the .feb file extension) and then start FEBio,
 passing the input file to it.
 Depending on the selected launch configuration,
 FEBio will run in the same process (default),
 or in a separate process.
 Users can create special launch configuration that will run FEBio on a remote server.
 The output generated by FEBio is displayed on the Log panel.

 This will load the job's plot file and open it in FEBio Studio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you open a plot file in FEBio Studio you will notice that the UI changes.
 The Model and Build panels will disappear and the Post panel will appear.
 The Build toolbar is also replaced by the Post toolbar.
 The Post panel has somewhat the same purpose as the Model panel and displays a tree structure of the contents of the plot file.

environment),
 or whether you are analyzing a model's result (the 
\emph on
Post
\emph default
 environment).
 In this chapter,
 the

FEBio Studio has a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) that offers an intuitive approach to setting up a finite element problem.
 It has several components to it,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Graphics View shows a 3D view of the current model.
 The user can adjust the view in several ways.
 The fastest way of maneuvering through the view is by using the mouse.
 The different mouse buttons invoke different commands depending on the current 
\emph on
mode 
\emph default
of the Graphics View.
 There are four buttons on the Toolbar that control this mode,
 namely the 
\emph on
select
\emph default
,
 
\emph on
move
\emph default
,
 
\emph on
rotate 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
scale 
\emph default
buttons.
 The current mode is indicated by the button that is highlighted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the Graphics view mode,
 the view can be rotated by dragging the mouse button outside any geometry while holding down the left mouse button.
 A similar action but with the right mouse button down allows the user to zoom the view.
 The user can pan the current view by holding down the middle mouse button.
 Objects and items can be selected in all four Graphics view modes.
 To select an object or item (e.g.
 part,
 surface,
 edge),
 bring the mouse cursor over the object or item,
 and click on it with the left mouse button.
 To add objects or items to the current selection,
 hold down the shift button while clicking on the object or item.
 To add several objects or items,
 drag the mouse while holding down the shift button and left mouse button.
 To deselect objects or items,
 the same operations can be performed,
 only this time,
 hold down the ctrl button instead of the shift button.
 To deselect all objects or items at once,
 click in an empty area of the Graphics View.
 There are also several menu items that allow you to modify the current selection.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default,
 FEBio Studio renders the model using 
\emph on
perspective projection
\emph default
 in the Graphics View.
 By right-clicking with the mouse button a popup menu shows up under the cursor that allows the user to toggle between perspective and orthographic projection.
 In addition,
 this menu provides some buttons that allows the user to quickly orient the geometry along one of the three coordinate axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Graphics View is in one of three transform modes (move,
 rotate or scale) a triad will appear in the center of the selection.
 When moving the mouse over the triad,
 one of its arms may highlight,
 indicating that this arm can be selected.
 To apply a transformation to the current selection,
 bring the mouse cursor over one of the triad arms so that it highlights.
 Next,
 drag the mouse button while holding down the left mouse button.
 Releasing the left mouse button will let go of the arm and finish the transformation.

\begin_layout Standard
Some components of the model,
 such as materials,
 named selections,
 and boundary conditions,
 need to be applied to a selection of the geometry.
 These components will have a selection box in the Model Viewer to which items of the model can be assigned to.
 For instance,
 for materials,
 it will show the parts of the model to which the material is assigned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The list that is displayed in the selection box can be edited using the buttons located on the right side of the selection box.
 Note that you can select the items in the selection box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Area
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Calculator This tool calculates the surface area A of selected faces.
 It also projects this surface area along the three coordinate directions as Ax,
 Ay and Az.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Import
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Springs This tool imports a collection of line elements from a text or VTK file and produces either discrete (i.e.
 spring) elements,
 or linear truss elements.
 This tool expects that the user has an object selected (which has to be an editable mesh) to which the new nodes and line elements will be added.
 When adding new nodes,
 first the tool will check if a node already exists at that location (within the user-defined tolerance) and if so,
 pick the existing node.
 If no node exists at the location,
 a new node will be added to the object.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Check for intersection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option will check if the new line elements intersect with the existing mesh,
 and if so,
 will truncate the element at the intersection point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Quadric
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Fit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool fits a quadric surface to the selected faces.
 Quadrics include ellipsoids,
 cylinders and cones.
 The general equation fitted to the data is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}F\left(X,Y,Z\right) & =C_{0}X^{2}+C_{1}Y^{2}+C_{2}Z^{2}\\
 & +C_{3}YZ+C_{4}ZX+C_{5}XY\\
 & +C_{6}X+C_{7}Y+C_{8}Z+C_{9}=0
\end{aligned}
\,.
\]

\end_inset

This equation may be rewritten in matrix form as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F\left(X,Y,Z\right)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
X & Y & Z\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
C_{0} & C_{5} & C_{4}\\
C_{5} & C_{1} & C_{3}\\
C_{4} & C_{3} & C_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
Y\\
Z
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
C_{6} & C_{7} & C_{8}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
Y\\
Z
\end{array}\right]+C_{9}=0\,.
\]

\end_inset

Once the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}-C_{9}$
\end_inset

 are obtained,
 the principal axes of the quadric may be found by evaluating the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 and eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{v}_{0},\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 coefficient matrix,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
C_{0} & C_{5} & C_{4}\\
C_{5} & C_{1} & C_{3}\\
C_{4} & C_{3} & C_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[Q\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{0} & 0 & 0\\
0 & c_{1} & 0\\
0 & 0 & c_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[Q\right]^{T}\,,
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[Q\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
v_{0x} & v_{1x} & v_{2x}\\
v_{0y} & v_{1y} & v_{2y}\\
v_{0z} & v_{1z} & v_{2z}
\end{array}\right]\,.
\]

\end_inset

Then,
 in the basis of these eigenvectors,
 the equation of the quadric may be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F\left(x,y,z\right)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
x & y & z\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{0} & 0 & 0\\
0 & c_{1} & 0\\
0 & 0 & c_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{6} & c_{7} & c_{9}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right]+c_{9}=0\,,
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right]=\left[Q\right]^{T}\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
Y\\
Z
\end{array}\right]\,,\quad\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{6}\\
c_{7}\\
c_{8}
\end{array}\right]=\left[Q\right]^{T}\left[\begin{array}{c}
C_{6}\\
C_{7}\\
C_{8}
\end{array}\right]\,,\quad c_{9}=C_{9}\,.
\]

\end_inset

The different types of quadric surfaces are described on Wikipedia (
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\begin_layout Description
Kinemat The Kinemat tool allows users to setup an FEBio problem using only geometry and kinematics data.
 The geometry is assumed to be rigid bodies,
 and the kinemat data describes the motion of the rigid parts.FEBio Studio will read the data and construct a complete FEBio model:
 Rigid materials are assigned to each bone.
 The kinemat data is used to apply prescribed displacements and rotations for each rigid body.
 After import,
 the model can be saved and run immediately in FEBio.

\begin_layout Section
The Repository Panel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This panel provides access to the online FEBio model repository.
 This repository is a way for FEBio users to easily access models created by other users,
 and to share models of their own from within FEBio Studio itself.
 The repository is not meant to be used as cloud storage for in-progress models,
 but as a means of sharing well-built,
 thoroughly-tested models with the FEBio community.
\end_layout

One particularly useful type of load controller is the 
\emph on
load curve
\emph default
,
 which consists of 
\emph on
time,value 
\emph default
pairs that will be interpolated.
 FEBio Studio often associates a default load curve to certain parameters of boundary conditions and loads.
 This default load curve ramps up the value from zero to one over the unit time interval.
 However,
 all curves can be modified using the tools available at the bottom of the Curve Editor.
 The curve's data points are represented as dots on the view.
 These data points can be selected by clicking on them with the left mouse button.
 They can also be moved by click
\begin_inset Formula $+$

dragging them.
 The current (time,
 value) pair of the selected point is displayed on the toolbar at the bottom of the view.
 This toolbar offers the following features.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio offers several geometry and mesh creation tools.
 Most of these tools can be found on the Build panel and its sub-panels.
 The Build panel offers the following sub-panels:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Create This panel has tools for creating primitive geometries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Edit The Edit panel is used to change geometry parameters of shape.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Mesh The Mesh panel is used to mesh the selected object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Tools Several specialized tools for creating and editing geometry and meshes can be found here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections describe the features of these panels in more detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Creating Geometry
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:creating"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although FEBioStudio is not designed to be a mesh generator,
 it has a few features to create simple geometries and meshes.
 Most of these options are available from the 
\emph on
Create 
\emph default
panel,
 which is a sub-panel of the 
\emph on
Build 
\emph default
panel.
 At the top it shows the various creation options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Primitives
\emph default
:
 Create simple geometric shapes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Discrete Objects
\emph default
:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most commonly used creation option is 
\emph on
primitives
\emph default
.
 When selected,
 a list of available primitives is shown.
 When selecting a primitive,
 its creation parameters are shown.
 After entering the desired values,
 click the 
\emph on
Create 
\emph default
button to create the primitive and add it to the model.
 The new object will be automatically selected in the Graphics View and shown in the Model Viewer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a primitive is created,
 its parameters can be changed in the 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Importing Geometry
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:importing"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of creating geometry directly in FEBioStudio it is more common to create your geometry in dedicated software and import the mesh into FEBioStudio.
 FEBioStudio can import several different mesh file formats.
 Geometry can be imported using the 
\emph on
File/Import Geometry 
\emph default
menu.
 Appendix A lists an overview of all the supported file formats including the supported features of the particular formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Editing Geometry
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:editing"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel,
 one of the panels on the Build panel,
 gives access to the object's creation parameters and editing options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other feature to note at the top of both the Edit and Mesh panels is the Object rollout.
 This shows the name of the active object as well as its type.
 The type of the object affects what tools will be available for editing and meshing the geometry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An object can be converted to a different type via the 
\emph on
Convert 
\emph default
button.
 Two options are available:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Editable surface
\emph default
:
 An object of this type will have a surface mesh that can be modified.
 A separate volume mesh can be generated for this object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Editable mesh
\emph default
:
 An object of this type will only contain a volume mesh and this mesh can be modified if necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editable surfaces and editable meshes will be explained in detail in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:mylabel22"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editing Primitives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For primitives the same parameters as when the object was created are shown on the 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel.
 This allows you to change the primitives dimensions at any time.
 If the object is not a primitive,
 no options will be shown here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that changing the primitive parameters will discard the FE mesh if one was already created.
 The primitive will have to be meshed again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editing Editable Surfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\emph on
editable surface 
\emph default
is defined via a surface mesh.
 This surface mesh can be modified via the tools on the 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that changing the surface mesh of an editable surface will discard the FE mesh if one was already created.
 The object will have to be meshed again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sections below discuss each of the available tools in more detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Auto Partition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The surface of an editable surface can be partitioned (i.e.
 divided) into several partitions.
 By default,
 FEBio Studio will automatically generate a partitioning based on finding the crease edges.
 If for some reason the resulting partitioning is not correct,
 the user can re-run the auto-partitioning tool.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The auto-partition tool partitions the geometry into surfaces by identifying the crease edges.
 A crease edge is an edge between two surface facets whose normals make an angle that is larger than the crease angle.
 To manually create surface partitions,
 use the Partition tool instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Decimate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decimation is the process of decreasing the number of triangles in the mesh.
 This tool decimates the triangular surface mesh using an approximate Centroidal Voronoi Diagram based approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Scale
\emph default
:
 This option helps in creating a uniform triangular mesh.
 Scale value specifies the desired reduction in the total number of nodes in the final decimated mesh.
 For example a 0.4 value of scale will result in the final decimated mesh with 40% of current number of nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Edge Collapse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This filter collapses all edges with a length that is below the given threshold value.
 This can be useful for eliminating small triangles or very narrow triangles,
 which may improve the quality of the mesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fix Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool provides several options to fix specific common problems in surface meshes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remove duplicate elements
\emph default
:
 removes elements that are repeated in the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remove non-manifold elements
\emph default
:
 removes element that have an invalid connectivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Fix winding
\emph default
:
 This option works only for triangular mesh.
 This option checks if the nodes of the triangle are in the same sequence clockwise/anti-clockwise direction for all the triangular facets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Fill all holes
\emph default
:
 Finds and fills the holes in the triangular mesh by adding new triangular faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Flip Edges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flips the selected edge.
 This can be useful to eliminate slivers or otherwise locally improve the mesh quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
MMG Remesh
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:MMG-Remesh-2D"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MMG Remesh tool uses the MMG library
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
https://www.mmgtools.org/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to regenerate the surface mesh.
 The following options can be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Element size
\series default
:
 Desired element size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Min element size
\series default
:
 The minimum element size allowed.
 MMG cannot always guarantee that this criterion is met.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Global Hausdorff value
\series default
:
 Sets the maximum allowed distance from the triangle mesh to the locally interpolated quadratic surface.
 Setting this to a smaller value creates a refined mesh in areas of large curvature.
 Note that this is a distance,
 so the units are length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Gradation
\series default
:
 Sets the rate of transition between a refined and coarser area.
 A value close to one creates a very wide transition area.
 Larger values allow for narrower transition areas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Only remesh selection
\series default
:
 If checked (and a current selection is active),
 only the selection will be remeshed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used for globally remeshing the surface,
 or for doing a local mesh refinement.
 To perform a local mesh refinement,
 select the faces that should be refined,
 and make sure to check the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

only remesh selection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Partition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Partition tool creates a partition (i.e.
 a selectable geometry surface) from the current node,
 edge,
 or face selection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool is useful when the auto-partition tool did not create a desirable partitioning of the surface mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Project Curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool projects a curve on the mesh and modifies the mesh locally so that the curve becomes a crease edge of the surface mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 select the curves (i.e.
 edges of other geometry) and assign them to the selection box.
 Then,
 click Apply.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Refine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool uniformly refines the mesh by splitting all elements.
 Triangles are split into 3 triangles,
 and quads are split into 3 smaller quads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Smooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Performs a simple mesh smoothing,
 where each node is moved towards the average of its neighbors.
 The new node position is defined by,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{r}_{new}=(1-\lambda)\boldsymbol{r}_{old}+\lambda\boldsymbol{r}_{c}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}_{new}$
\end_inset

is the new position,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}_{old}$
\end_inset

is the old position,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}_{c}$
\end_inset

is the average of the node neighbors,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a weight factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following parameters can be set:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Iterations
\series default
:
 Enter the value to repeat the smoothing operation several times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
lambda
\series default
:
 The weight factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in the equation above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
preserve shape
\series default
:
 When checked,
 the new nodal positions are projected back onto the original mesh.
 This is useful the counteract the shrinking that typically occurs when applying this smoothing filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
preserve edge
\series default
:
 When checked,
 nodes that were on an edge on the original geometry,
 are forced to remain on that edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Weld Nodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Weld Nodes
\emph default
 tool merges the selected nodes that are within the specified tolerance.
 Any edges or faces that collapse as a result,
 will be removed from the mesh as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Creating and Editing a Mesh
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:mylabel22"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Mesh panel 
\emph default
gives access to FEBio Studio's meshing capabilities.
 As noted before,
 FEBioStudio was not designed to be a powerful mesh generator,
 but regardless,
 it has some simple mesh generation and editing features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meshing Primitives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the object is a primitive,
 that is,
 created with one of the geometry creation tools,
 the command window will list the mesh creation parameters for that particular object.
 Most primitives will be meshed with a so-called 
\emph on
butterfly mesh
\emph default
.
 These primitives have a simple rectangular box as center.
 The rest of the mesh is a projection from this box to the respective geometry.
 For instance,
 for the sphere the surface of the inner box is projected onto a sphere.
 This projection is segmented to create several layers of elements.
 Note that all solid primitives are composed of 8-noded hexahedral elements and all shell primitives are composed of 4-noded quadrilateral elements,
 although some primitives may offer different element options.
 After you change the mesh parameters simply press the 
\emph on
Apply 
\emph default
button to create the new mesh.
 To show the mesh in the Graphics View select the 
\emph on
View/Toggle Mesh lines
\emph default
 menu or use the '
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

' shortcut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meshing CAD Geometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CAD objects are meshed with the NetGen library.
 The NetGen mesher is a multi-pass mesh generator.
 It generates a base mesh and then tries to improve the mesh over several iterations.
 The following parameters control the mesh generation process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Mesh Granularity:

\series default
 set level of detail.
 This sets several internal parameters that affect the final element density.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $0<\text{grading}\le1$
\end_inset

).
 This global parameter describes how fast the mesh-size decreases.
 (Warning:
 Picking a very small value,
 e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $<0.01$
\end_inset

,
 could cause Netgen to crash.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Max element size:

\series default
 Set the largest allowed element size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Min element size:

\series default
 Set the smallest allowed element size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

\begin_layout Subsection
Meshing Editable Surfaces
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Meshing-Editable-Surfaces"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\emph on
editable surface
\emph default
 is an object that is defined via a surface mesh.
 The surface mesh can be edited via the tools on the Edit panel.
 If the mesh is closed and composed of triangles,
 the object can be meshed using 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Tetgen"
target "https://www.wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 available from the Mesh panel.
 This tool will generate a tetrahedral mesh.
 The following options can be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Element size:

\series default
 the desired size of the elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Quality:

\series default
 the desired quality of the elements.
 The quality of the element is defined as the ratio of the radius of the circumscribed sphere over the shortest edge length.
 The theoretical minimum is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{6}/4\approx0.621$
\end_inset

.

Editable Meshes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the object is a so-called 
\emph on
editable mesh 
\emph default
the Mesh panel will list some mesh editing tools.
 Editable meshes don't have a geometry object associated with it so the mesh,
 or at least its surface,
 defines the geometry implicitly.
 This has some important consequences related to applying boundary conditions to an editable mesh.
 Any change to the mesh may also change the corresponding geometry and as a consequence any data that was associated with the previous geometry may become invalid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Important Note.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Boundary Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For certain types of analyses (e.g.
 biphasic or computational fluid dynamics),
 it may be important to refine the mesh near the boundary to capture rapid boundary layer effects.
 The Boundary Layer tool can be used to generate a thin layer of refined elements.
 The tool requires a facet selection.
 It then finds the layer of solid elements adjacent to the selected faces,
 and then subdivides these elements,
 using the given control parameters:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
bias
\series default
:
 Sets the refinement gradation level.
 If equal to one,
 all elements will have the same size.
 If larger than one,
 elements will shrink as they get closer to the surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
segments
\series default
:
 Sets the number of divisions each boundary element will be divided in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this tool may introduce different types of elements.
 For instance,
 when applied to a tetrahedral mesh,
 the boundary layer may contain tetrahedral,
 wedge,
 and hexahedral elements.
 The quality of the elements in the boundary layer may also be degraded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a tetrahedral mesh was generated with TetGen (Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Convert Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convert the element type to a different type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When converting between linear and quadratic elements,
 nodes are inserted in (or removed from) edges and faces.
 The number of elements is not affected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When converting between linear element types,
 elements may be split and the total number of elements will increase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Create shells from faces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inflate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Create a biased mesh in an existing tetrahedral mesh,
 by extruding the selected surface inward,
 producing pentahedral elements,
 then remeshing the inner domain with TetGen.
 This can be useful for analyzing boundary layer responses in the vicinity of the selected surface.
\end_layout

To use this tool,
 select the faces adjacent to the elements that will be inflated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 below),
 using the selected crease angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Invert
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used to invert the selected elements.
 Elements that are inverted (i.e.
 turned inside-out) have negative volumes and cannot be used in an FE simulation.
 This can happen when the mesh was generated with a tool that assumes a different element nodal connectivity.
 This tool can be used to fix this problem.

 The following parameters can be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Element size
\series default
:
 Desired element size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Min element size
\series default
:
 The minimum element size allowed.
 MMG cannot always guarantee that this criterion is met.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Global Hausdorff value
\series default
:
 Sets the maximum allowed distance from the surface mesh to the locally interpolated quadratic surface.
 Setting this to a smaller value creates a refined mesh in areas of large curvature.
 Note that this is a distance,
 so the units are length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Gradation
\series default
:
 Sets the rate of transition between a refined and coarser area.
 A value close to one creates a very wide transition area.
 Larger values allow for narrower transition areas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Only remesh selection
\series default
:
 If checked (and a current selection is active),
 only the selection will be remeshed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used for global remeshing,
 or for doing a local mesh refinement or coarsening.
 To perform a local mesh refinement/coarsening,
 select the elements that should be refined,
 and make sure to check the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Partition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Partition tool creates a partition from the current node,
 edge,
 face,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used to fix any issues related to mesh connectivity.
 It rebuilds the internal mesh data structures.
 Note that this tool may affect the mesh partitioning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool should not be used often.
 It should only be used if any other mesh operation leaves the mesh with an invalid internal data structure.
 Before applying this tool,
 you can use the Mesh Diagnostic tool to check if there are problems with the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Refine Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Refines the triangular shell mesh uniformly by dividing each triangular face into 4 smaller triangles.
 In this method,
 a new node is added at the center of each edge of the triangle and new triangles are created using these new nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Revolve Faces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the Face Extrude tool,
 but the selected faces are extruded by revolving them around an axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rezone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool can be used to locally rezone a mesh.
 This is useful for refining or coarsening a mesh near a boundary,
 without the need to remesh the area.
 This tool simply moves nodes around in order to obtain the desired zoning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Set Axis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tools can be used to generate local material axes on each element.
 Different algorithms can be chosen using the 
\emph on
generator 
\emph default
option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
vector The first option for generating material axes is 
\emph on
vector
\emph default
.
 This option allows you to specify the same set of material axes for all elements of the mesh.
 In general,
 this option is useful if the desired material axes are not aligned with the global XYZ coordinate system.
 For this option you are prompted to enter the
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 vectors that uniquely define the XYZ axes triad.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 represents the local X-direction,
 and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 is used to produce the local Z-direction from the cross product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 the Y-direction is obtained form the right-hand rule from the cross-product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 FEBioStudio automatically normalizes the vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
angles This option is similar to the vector option described in the previous section.
 It produces a uniform set of material axes using the azimuthal angle theta (°) and declination angle phi (°) of a spherical coordinate system as shown in the FEBio User's Manual.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
node-numbering This option is generally useful only when the mesh consists of hexahedral elements,
 such as hex8,
 hex20 and hex27 elements,
 created in a regular pattern.
 Users need to specify three nodes,
 n0,
 n1 and n2,
 which must have values between 1 and 8,
 representing the 8 corner nodes of a hexahedral element.
 FEBioStudio treats the line segment between nodes n0 and n1 as the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

,
 and the line segment from n0 to n2 as the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

,
 from which it produces local XYZ axes as explained in vector above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
cylindrical The last option under the generator pull-down menu of Set Axes is the cylindrical option.This option may be used to produce local material axes that are aligned with a cylindrical coordinate system whose long axis (the local Z-direction) is along the user-specified vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and whose radial direction (the local X-direction) is along the user-specified
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 vector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Set Axis from curvature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many geometries for which the options described in the Set Axes section for generating material axes may not be suitable.
 For example,
 consider a torus geometry that includes two families of fibers,
 each oriented along one of the two principal radii of the Torus.
 Thus we may wish to generate local material axes that are aligned along the principal directions of curvature of the toroidal surface.
 The following options can be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this tool,
 first make a face selection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
generator This option determines who to approximate the local surface in order to estimate the principal axes of curvature.
 For general surface,
 choose 
\emph on
spline
\emph default
,
 but if the surface is a quadric surface (e.g.
 cone,
 cylinder,
 ellipsoid),
 the 
\emph on
quadric 
\emph default
option may perform better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
whole_part The box labeled Whole part ensures that local material axes are assigned to all elements inside the geometry,
 not just the ones right underneath the selected faces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool may be particularly useful with meshes that represent anatomical features,
 as typically acquired from medical images.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Set Fibers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tools can be used to generate local material fibers on each element.
 Different algorithms can be chosen using the 
\emph on
generator 
\emph default
option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
vector The first option for generating fibers is 
\emph on
vector
\emph default
.
 This option allows you to specify the same fiber vector for all elements of the mesh.
 For this option you are prompted to enter the fiber vector directly.
 FEBioStudio automatically normalizes the vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
node-numbering This option is generally useful only when the mesh consists of hexahedral elements,
 such as hex8,
 hex20 and hex27 elements,
 created in a regular pattern.
 Users need to specify two nodes,
 n0 and n1,
 which must have values between 1 and 8,
 representing the 8 corner nodes of a hexahedral element.
 FEBioStudio treats the line segment between nodes n0 and n1 as the fiber vector .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shell Thickness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set the shell thickness for the selected shell elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Smooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option works only for triangular shell meshes.
 It smooths the mesh by iteratively moving points towards their neighbors and often results in better-shaped triangles and more evenly distributed nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Iterations
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
TetGen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool applies the TetGen mesher to a tetrahedral mesh.
 It can be used to recreate or remesh a tet4 mesh locally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
minimum radius-edge ratio
\series default

 allows TetGen to split surface facets if necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

\series default
:
 sets the number of element layers of the transition zone between the locally remeshed part and the rest of the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Weld Nodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weld the selected nodes together that are within a distance specified by the 
\emph on

\emph default
 edit field.
 Welding is useful to connect touching parts together.
 However,
 be aware that you might create unexpected errors in your geometry this way since the effects of welding are not always visible.

\begin_layout Chapter
Generating and Editing Mesh Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio allows the use of mesh data maps in a model,
 i.e.
 values assigned to individual nodes or elements of a mesh that can be used in various contexts.
 For instance,
 it can be used to assign a different material parameter value to each element,
 or prescribe a different nodal value for each node of a prescribed displacement boundary condition.
 FEBio offers two mechanisms for defining mesh data:
 The data can be defined explicitly via a map,
 i.e.
 a single value defined for each element or node,
 or it can be defined implicitly through 
\emph on
mesh data generators
\emph default
.
 The latter are procedural approaches that generate the actual mesh data map when FEBio starts.
 FEBio Studio supports both types of mesh data and in addition offers several tools for generating,
 editing,
 and visualizing mesh data
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In general,
 it is best to avoid giving the mesh data map the same name as the model's variable to which it will be assigned.
 For instance,
 if the map is to be used for a material parameter named 'E',
 don't name the map 'E' as well.
 Instead,
 name it for instance 'E_map'.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
type Select whether the map represents nodal,
 element,

 The 'node' option will assign a unique value to each node of the domain.
 For instance,
 for element data,
 the data is assigned to the (shared) nodes of the elements.
 The mesh data therefore represents a continuous datafield over the domain.
 The 'mult' option assigns a unique value for each node of each element.
 Neighboring elements may have different values for each node they share.
 The resulting datafield may be discontinuous across element boundaries.

 The 'list' option will generate a value for each item of the map and is typically what you want.
 The 'constant' option will not generate a value for each item,
 but instead will assign a single constant value to the entire map.
 This is only useful for very specific applications.

Once all properties are set,
 click OK to add the mesh data map to the model.
 At this point,

\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the tool,
 first enter a name for the resulting mesh data map in the 
\emph on
Name
\emph default
 field.
 Next,
 you can assign values to mesh selections.
 For example,
 if certain values are desired on specific surfaces,
 edges,
 or nodes,
 then the following steps will accomplish that goal:
 make a selection on the mesh,
 enter the desired value in the 
\emph on
value 
\emph default
field,
 click the 
\series bold
Add
\series default
 button.
 A new entry will be added in the table.
 The values assigned to the selections can still be edited by double-clicking the value in the table and entering a new value.
 This procedure can be repeated as many times as needed to assign different values to selections.
 Note that it is not necessary to assign values to every item (i.e.
 node or element) of the mesh.
 Instead,
 only values on some boundary surfaces or edges are needed.
 The values for the interior of the mesh are calculated by the tool.
 It accomplishes this by solving a Poisson problem on the mesh,
 using the provided values as boundary conditions on the corresponding mesh selections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following parameters further specify the data map that will be generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Data
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

format Set how the tool will output the values,
 i.e.
 as nodal data or element data.
 This choice may affect how the data map can be used in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Material Currently,
 data is only generated for the parts to which a particular material is assigned.
 This option allows you to select the material,
 and the corresponding parts on which data is generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tool uses an iterative method for solving the Poisson problem.
 The remainder of the parameters control the solution process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Max
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

iterations Set the maximum number of iterations that can be used by the iterative solver.
 Setting this value too low may result in an unconverged solution to the Poisson problem.
 The default value of 1000 will be sufficient for most problems,
 but models with large meshes my need to increase this value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Tolerance The convergence tolerance for the iterative method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SOR
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

parameter Sets the SOR (Successive Over Relaxation) parameter,
 which may significantly decrease the number of iterations necessary for convergence.
 The default value will likely work well for most applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To run the tool,
 click the 
\series bold
Create
\series default
 Button.
 This will solve for the nodal or element values,
 given the boundary conditions to the Poisson problem,
 create the mesh data map,
 assign the values,
 and add it to the model.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tool works very similarly to the scalar field tool.
 First,
 users assign (scalar) values to specific mesh selections.
 It then solves a Poisson problem on the mesh using the provided values as prescribed boundary conditions on the selections.
 This results in a scalar field.
 The tool then proceeds by numerically evaluating the gradient of this scalar field.
 This defines the initial vector field.
 Additional parameters allow further modifications of this vector field.

After you selected the step and the type of boundary condition,
 simply press OK to add the boundary condition to the model and edit the parameters in the Model Viewer.

\begin_layout Standard
In general,
 there are two types of boundary conditions.
 There are the 
\emph on
fixed constraints 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
prescribed constraints
\emph default
.
 For a fixed constraint (e.g.
 zero displacement),
 the corresponding degree of freedom is kept zero throughout the entire analysis.
 For a prescribed constraint (e.g.
 prescribed displacement),
 the value of the corresponding degree of freedom is defined by the user.
 You may wonder why the fixed constraints are available,
 since you can achieve the same result by defining a zero value for a prescribed constraint.
 The reason is that the degrees of freedom for fixed constraints are removed from the linear system of equations,
 reducing the computational time to solve the linear system.
 On the other hand,
 since the equations are removed,
 no reaction loads are calculated for fixed constraints.
 If you need to know for instance the reaction force on a boundary,
 you need to use a prescribed displacement even if the displacement is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to know that with most prescribed constraints a default load curve will be associated.
 The actual value for the constraint at any given time is the product of the scale factor which you will enter in the properties dialog for the boundary condition and the value of the load curve at that time.
 Since by default the load curve will ramp from zero to one,
 the constraint value will ramp from zero to the specified value in a linear way.
 If you wish to modify the default curve you can edit it in the Curve Editor.

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases,
 different parts of a model can come into contact with each other.
 Once parts make contact,
 there are many different ways in which their motion can be constrained.
 Parts can slide across each other,
 stick to one another,
 etc.
 All these different contact behaviors can be modeled via contact definitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most contact definitions can be divided into one of two categories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
tied Two,
 nonconforming,
 surfaces can be

glued

\end_inset

 together with a tied interface.
 This is most commonly used when two parts are connected to each other at an interface,
 but their meshes are not conforming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
sliding A sliding interface allows two opposing surfaces to come into contact,
 and then slide across each other.

In FEBio,
 contact constraints are enforced using an 
\emph on
Augmented Lagrangian 
\emph default
approach.
 This implies that the Lagrange multipliers are only approximated to a user-specified tolerance.
 The following parameters will appear in nearly all contact interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
augmented Lagrangian
\series default
:
 Turn the augmented Lagrangian method on or off.
 When off,
 a penalty method is used for constraint enforcement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
augmentation tolerance
\series default
:
 Set the convergence tolerance for the Lagrange multipliers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Penalty factor:
 
\series default
The penalty factor controls the rate of convergence.
 A high penalty factor will try to reach the tolerance quickly,
 but if chosen too high might introduce instability into the system.
 If it is too low,
 convergence to within the specified tolerance might not be reached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sliding interfaces,
 there will usually be an option for 
\emph on
two-pass
\emph default
 option.
 In a usual contact implementation,
 the required integrations are only performed over one of the surfaces,
 usually referred to as the 
\emph on
primary 
\emph default
surface.
 If the contacting surfaces are perfectly smooth,
 it does not matter which surface acts as the primary or secondary surface.
 However,
 in an FE simulation the surfaces are discretized and are most likely non-conforming.
 Thus,
 the choice of primary and secondary surfaces is important and will introduce bias in the solution.
 It is usually advisable to select the more finely meshed surface as the primary.
 In the 
\emph on
two pass algorithm
\emph default
,
 an attempt is made to reduce the bias by performing the contact calculations twice,
 with the roles of primary and secondary surface switched for the second pass.
 Although it may appear that the two pass algorithm is always the best choice,
 this is not always so.
 Certain contact applications perform better using a single pass.
 See the 
\emph on
FEBio Theory Manual 
\emph default
for a more detailed description of the contact model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the contact parameters are entered the user needs to define the 
\emph on
primary 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
secondary
\emph default
 contacting surfaces.
 To do this,
 first close the contact interface dialog and select the contact interface in the Model Editor.
 In the Model Editor you will now notice two selection boxes,
 one for the primary surface and one for the secondary surface.
 The boxes work similarly as for boundary conditions.
 For instance,
 to add a surface of your model to the primary surface,
 select the surface in the Graphics View and press the '
\begin_inset Formula $+$

' button in the primary's surface selection box.

\begin_layout Section
Nonlinear constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from contact,
 FEBio offers several types of nonlinear constraints that in some way constrain the solution of the finite element problem.
 In FEBio Studio,
 these constraints are differentiated based on whether they apply to surfaces or to volumetric bodies.
 Constraints that don't quite fit in either category are referred to as general constraints.

Similar to contact,
 these nonlinear constraints are enforced using an Augmented Lagrangian method.

\begin_layout Chapter
Rigid Bodies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigid bodies are bodies that are assumed to be undeformable.
 They can only move and rotate and therefore are described by 6 degrees of freedom,
 3 for translation and 3 for rotation.
 Rigid bodies are useful for modeling very stiff objects In FEBio (and FEBio Studio).
 Rigid bodies have their own set of constraints,
 initial conditions,
 and loads.
 They can also be connected via special model components called rigid connectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigid bodies are implicitly created when a 
\emph on
rigid body 
\emph default
material is added to the model.
 This implies that in principle rigid bodies do not need any geometry.
 They are defined completely via the corresponding rigid material definition.
 The only exception is that if the rigid body interacts with other,
 deformable,
 parts of the model via contact,
 then the rigid body needs to have geometry.
 Since the rigid body is defined via its material,
 you can easily make a part of the model rigid by assigning it a rigid material.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rigid Body Constraints
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:rigid-1"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degrees of freedom of rigid bodies can be constrained in the same way as any other degree of freedom in the model.
 Before you can apply a constraint to a rigid body,
 you need to define a rigid body.
 In FEBioStudio,
 rigid bodies are implicitly defined when you create a rigid body material.
 A rigid body constraint can now be applied using the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Rigid Constraint 
\emph default
menu.
 It is important to note that when a rigid body is created none of its degrees of freedom are initially constrained.

The Rigid Boundary Condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted above,
 rigid bodies don't require geometry (except when used in contact) and are implicitly defined via rigid body materials.
 In order to tie a deformable body to a rigid body,
 a special boundary condition,
 the 
\emph on
rigid 
\emph default
boundary condition,
 is used.
 The rigid boundary condition is added as any other boundary condition (e.g.
 via the menu Physics/Add Nodal BC).
 Any selection of a deformable object (e.g.
 surface) that is assigned to this boundary condition will be tied to the rigid body.
 The rigid body that the selection ties to,
 is set as a parameter of the rigid boundary condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rigid boundary condition should not be used to tie two rigid parts together.
 The easiest way to tie rigid parts together is to assign them the same rigid body material.

When you start FEBioStudio or create a new model using the

 you'll notice that FEBioStudio by default creates one step,
 namely the 
\emph on
Initial

step.
 This initial step does not perform an actual analysis;
 instead it is a placeholder for the initialization phase of the analysis.
 Currently,
 the most important aspect of this step is that all boundary conditions,
 loads,
 constraints,
 etc.
 that are defined in this step will remain active during all subsequent analysis steps.
 This is different from an analysis step in that e.g.
 a boundary condition defined in an analysis step will only remain active during that step.

Although FEBio Studio tries to select some default,
 commonly used variables based on the analysis type,
 it is highly recommended to always check the list of selected plot variables to ensure that the desired data will be written.
 Failure to do so,
 may result in loss of data and the need to re-run the analysis!

There are several types of launch configurations,
 each with a different set of fields to edit.
 With the exception of the 
\emph on
Local
\emph default
 launch configuration type,
 all types run your jobs on a remote server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Local
\emph default
 launch configuration type will launch the specified FEBio executable to run your job.
 This will be run on your current machine.
 The only field required is:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
FEBio Executable
\emph default
:
 The path to the local FEBio executable that you wish to run with this configuration
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 launch configuration type will copy your job files to a remote server via SFTP into the specified directory,
 and then run the job via SSH with the specified remote FEBio executable.
 To use a remote configuration,
 fill out the following fields:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
:
 The remote path to the FEBio executable that you wish to run with this configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Server
\emph default
:
 The domain name or IP address of the server that you wish to connect to via SSH/SFTP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Port
\emph default
:
 The port on your server on which the SSH service is being hosted.
 By default,
 this is set to 22,
 which is the standard port for the SSH protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Username
\emph default
:
 Your username on the remote machine.
 Your user account must have permissions to connect to the server via SSH.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Remote Directory
\emph default
:
 The remote directory to which your FEBio input file will be copied,
 and which will act as the working directory for your FEBio run.
 Unless otherwise specified in your input file,
 your log and plot files will be created here.
 This directory need not exist,
 and will be created automatically if it does not.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
PBS Queue
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
SLURM Queue
\emph default
 launch configuration types will copy your job files to a remote server via SFTP into the specified directory,
 and then add a new job to a PBS or SLURM queuing system.
 These launch configuration types each have all of the same fields as the 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 type,
 along with a text box in which a PBS or SLURM script may be edited.
 At launch,
 the contents of this text box are put into a file,
 transferred via SFTP to the remote server,
 and run with either the 
\emph on
qsub
\emph default
 (for PBS) or the 
\emph on
sbatch
\emph default
 (for SLURM) command.
 By default,
 the text box contains a valid PBS or SLURM script with some common options set.
 For convenience,
 several macros have been defined,
 which you may use in your script.
 Before being written to a file and being copied to the server,
 these macros are replaced with a string unique to either the launch configuration,
 or the current job.
 These macros are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${JOB_NAME}
\emph default
:
 This macro will be replaced with the name of the current job as defined in the 
\emph on
Run FEBio
\emph default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${REMOTE_DIR}
\emph default
:
 This macro will be replaced with the contents of the 
\emph on
Remote Directory
\emph default
 field in the launch configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
${FEBIO_PATH}
\emph default
:
 This macro will be replaced with the contents of the 
\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
 field in the launch configuration.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
Custom Remote
\emph default
 launch configuration type will copy your job files to a remote server via SFTP into the specified directory,
 and then run a set of specified commands in series on the remote server via SSH.
 This launch configuration type has all of the same fields as the 
\emph on
Remote
\emph default
 type,
 except for the 
\emph on
Remote Executable
\emph default
 field.
 It also has a text box in which a custom series of commands may be written,
 one on each line.
 There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a custom script:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The same macros available in the 
\emph on
PBS Queue
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
SLURM Queue
\emph default
 launch configuration types are available for use in this script,
 with the exception of the 
\emph on
${FEBIO_PATH}
\emph default
 macro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lines starting with the '#' symbol are comments and will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Empty lines are ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The full string of each line will be run as a separate command on the remote system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The script written in this field is not a bash script,
 but rather a set of discrete commands which will be executed in series.
 It is of course possible to run a bash script with this launch configuration type,
 by placing the desired script on the remote server,
 and then running the script by calling it in one of the lines of the text box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This launch configuration type allows for great flexibility.
 Using it,
 you can do pre and post processing of your FEBio jobs on a remote server with the click of a single button.
 Use this launch configuration type with caution,
 as it does not have any safety nets;
 anything you tell the remote server to do,
 it will do,
 as long as your user account has permissions to do it.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When an FEBio job is started using any of the remote launch configuration types,
 an SSH connection is made to the remote server.
 This requires authentication.
 If you have set up private key authentication for the specified server and username,
 the authentication will happen automatically.
 Otherwise,
 you will be prompted for your user account password during the first attempt to connect to the server.
 This password will be encrypted and stored in RAM for the duration of your FEBio Studio session,
 and will automatically used for subsequent server interactions until you close FEBio Studio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to retrieve the log and plot files from any of the remote launch configuration types,
 click the 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Using FEBio Plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio supports plugins that allow users to add new features to FEBio easily.
 As of FEBio Studio 2.0 plugins can be loaded into FEBio Studio and the model components defined in the plugin will be integrated in the UI.
 For example,
 if a plugin adds a new material,
 then the material will be available in the Material Browser.
 In addition,
 when using the 
\emph on
default 
\emph default
launch configuration,
 FEBio will automatically load all the plugins that were loaded in FEBio Studio so that special configuration file is needed.
 (For local and remote launch configuration you still need to prepare a special config file.) 
\end_layout

The FEBio Monitor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FEBio Monitor offers an alternative way to run FEBio models from FEBio Studio.
 Using the FEBio Monitor,
 users can have a live graphical view of the model's solution progress,
 as well as monitor the convergence norms using graphs.
 The solution progress can be paused at which point users can inspect the detailed model's state,
 including the current stiffness matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FEBio Monitor can be a helpful tool for debugging a model as it offers a direct visual way to inspect the solution progress,
 something that is otherwise difficult to obtain.
 Problems can be identified as soon as they occur,
 without the need to take any further post-processing steps.

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways,
 an FEBio Monitor session resembles a post session and offers many of the same features.
 However,
 there are a few noteworthy differences (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-FEBio-Monitor"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 The FEBio Monitor panel on the left has a 
\emph on
Watch
\emph default
 tab that by default displays all the model parameters that are load-controlled and shows the current value.
 (Note that this panel is only updated when the model is paused.) Users can also add additional entries in the table by double-clicking the empty slot below the last entry and entering the model parameter's name.
 In addition,
 on the bottom of the Watch panel,
 the 
\emph on
Matrix Inspector
\emph default
 can be accessed.
 The Matrix Inspector gives users a visualization of the current stiffness matrix as well as some tools to inspect and diagnose the matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As part of an FEBio Monitor session,
 a new toolbar is visible in the toolbar area near the top of the window.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the Watch panel,
 additional graphs are shown below the Graphics View that show various metrics of the active model.
 The graphs display the convergence norms of the model,
 typically the residual (R),
 energy (E),
 and overall solution norm (D),
 as well as additionally selected norms.
 The 
\emph on

\emph default
shows the current and maximum allocated memory.
 (Note that this is the memory consumption of FEBio Studio,
 not of FEBio.)

The Capture Frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capture frame is the area of the screen that will be captured when taking a screenshot or recording an animation.
 The capture frame is not always visible,
 but can be displayed by selecting the 
\emph on
View/Toggle Capture Frame
\emph default
 from the menu.
 The same menu will hide it again.
 The capture frame can be shown by selecting the keypad-'0' shortcut.
 When visible,
 the capture frame can be moved and resized by selecting one of the borders and dragging the mouse button.
 To resize it,
 you must grab the little triangular area in the lower right corner of the capture frame.
 If you wish to specify the location and size more accurately,
 you can open the properties dialog box,
 by selecting the 
\emph on
Edit/Properties 
\emph default
menu or by double-clicking on one of its borders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Taking a snapshot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To take a snapshot of the current Graphics View push the 
\emph on
snapshot 
\emph default
button on the toolbar.
 A standard 
\emph on
Save
\emph default
 dialog box appears and the desired filename can be entered or selected.
 Images can be saved as BMP,
 TIFF or JPEG images.
 To only capture a part of the Graphics View,
 make sure the capture frame is active.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of taking a screenshot,
 you can also create a ray-traced rendering of the current scene.
 A ray-traced rendering can create higher quality,
 arbitrary resolution,
 images,
 which may be more suited for journal articles or other high quality publications.
 Ray-tracing is often more suitable for rendering shadows and handling transparent materials.

\begin_layout Standard
Note that currently,
 the ray-tracer cannot render lines,
 so it will not show mesh lines or edges on the final image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Recording an animation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has the capability to record an animation of the current GV.
 To record an animation,
 first position and resize the capture frame so that it covers the desired area of the GV that will be captured.
 Next,
 select the 
\emph on
Record/New 
\emph default
menu.
 This opens a standard file dialog box where you can select a file format and enter the target filename.
 If the selected file format is an image format (.bmp,
 .tiff,
 etc.),
 the target filename will be the file template from which the actual filenames will be generated.
 Each frame will be stored in a separate file,
 where the frame number is appended to the file template.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you have selected a target file,
 you are ready for recording.
 Note that the capture frame will now be locked,
 so you can no longer move or resize it.
 If it is visible,
 it will turn red.
 The recording will begin in a paused state,
 allowing you to make some changes to the GV before recording begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start recording,
 select 
\emph on
Record/Start 
\emph default
from the menu or press the corresponding shortcut.
 Now,
 all the action in the GV will be recorded to the target file.
 For example,
 if you press the play button,
 the GV will loop over all timesteps and each step will be recorded to the file.
 You can also rotate the GV and this will also be recorded to the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To pause the recording,
 select 
\emph on
Record/Pause 
\emph default
from the menu.
 To finally stop the recording,
 select 
\emph on
Record/Stop 
\emph default
from the menu.
 This will close the target file and unlock the capture frame.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter the different post-processing tools are discussed that FEBio Studio offers to display the model's data.
 The user can define a displacement map that FEBio Studio will use to deform the model.
 The user can also define a colormap that defines the color of the different parts of the model according to the corresponding element or nodal value.
 The user can also add different types of plots to display data.
 Plane cuts can be made to conveniently hide parts of the model and to inspect the interior of the model.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When selecting the root
\emph on
 
\emph default
item in the View tab of the Post panel,
 the user can edit the properties of the model.
 The following properties are defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Element subdivisions:
 
\emph default
defines the number of subdivision levels.
 FEBio Studio subdivides the elements in the model to improve the quality of the renderings.
 However,
 increasing the number of subdivisions will also increase the time it takes to render the model so use this property judiciously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render mode:
 
\emph default
Sets the render mode to solid or wireframe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
 when selected 
\emph on
yes
\emph default
,
 FEBio Studio will draw an outline of the model in its undeformed state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Outline color:

\emph default
 set the color for the model outlines 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Node color:

\emph default
 set the color of the nodes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Selection color:

\emph default
 set the color of selected items 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render smooth -
\emph default
 when selected 
\emph on
yes
\emph default
,
 FEBio Studio will render the model smoothly.
 This means that it will vary the surface normal of the model to create a smooth surface.
 When selected 
\emph on
no
\emph default
,
 flat shading is used to render the model.
 Note that smooth shading can be significantly slower than flat shading due to the additional calculations that FEBio Studio needs to do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shells as hexes -
\emph default
 renders all shells as hexahedral elements using the shell thickness (if available) to extrude the shell surface in the normal direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shell reference surface -
\emph default
 defines how FEBio Studio needs to interpret the shell surface in relation to the shell volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Smoothing angle -
\emph default
 identifies the hard edges in the model.
 Edges with adjoining faces that have a surface normal,
 whose angle is more than the smoothing angle,
 are considered hard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Displacement Map
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:displacement"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio uses the displacement map to define the deformation of the model at each state.
 The displacement map can be accessed in the Model Viewer by selecting the item entitled 
\emph on
displacement map
\emph default
 (this is a sub-item of the 
\emph on
model 
\emph default
item).
 Click on it to display the properties in the Properties Window,
 located at the bottom of the Model Viewer.
 The Displacement map has two parameters that the user can change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
is the data field that FEBio Studio will use to calculate the model's deformation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Scale Factor:
 
\emph default
sets the displacement scale factor,
 which can be used to scale the displacements when displaying the model in the Graphics View.
 (This scale factor does affect strain measures.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you must enable the displacement map by clicking on the 
\emph on
enable 
\emph default
button in the Model Viewer (this is the button with the checkmark).
 Similarly,
 by clicking the button again the displacement map can be deactivated in which case the model will not be deformed when displaying the different time steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Color Map
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:color"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Color Map 
\emph default
defines how FEBio Studio will calculate the color that is used to display the model in the Graphics View.
 The Color Map's properties can be accessed by selecting the item in the Model Viewer entitled 
\emph on
Color Map
\emph default
.
 The properties will then be listed in the Properties Window below.
 The following properties are defined for the color map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Data field - 
\emph default
allows the user to select the data field that FEBio Studio will use to define the color of the model.
 The color of the model is defined by the data field and the color gradient (see below).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Gradient smoothing -
\emph default
 Colors the material by drawing a fringe plot of the selected data field.
 When gradient smoothing is on,
 the fringe colors are smoothed to produce a continuous transition between fringes.
 When this option is off,
 a discrete set of colors is used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Color map:
 
\emph default
defines the color map that will be used to color the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Nodal values -
\emph default
 FEBio Studio defines nodal data and element data.
 When displaying element data,
 the element data is projected to the nodes to produce a smooth rendering of the data.
 However,
 when this option is turned of,
 element data will be displayed by using a single color for each element.
 This will produce a discretized drawing of the data,
 but will be truer to the actual data since the element data is not interpolated before displaying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Range type -
\emph default
 FEBio Studio keeps track of the range of the selected data field (that is the minimum and maximum values).
 The user can use this option to select a 
\emph on
dynamic
\emph default
 range (range is updated for each state independently),
 a 
\emph on
static 
\emph default
range (range is calculate over all the states) or 
\emph on
user 
\emph default
range (user defines the minimum and maximum values).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Range divisions - 
\emph default
changes the number of fringes that will be drawn on the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
 sets the orientation of the legend bar (horizontal or vertical) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
User max/ User min -
\emph default
 defines the minimum and maximum range value when using the 
\emph on
user 
\emph default
range option for 
\emph on
range type
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When FEBio Studio starts,
 the colormap is turned off by default.
 To activate it,
 select the 
\emph on
enable 
\emph default
button in the Model Viewer.
 Similarly,
 to disable the color mapping,
 simply press this button again.
 When the colormap is turned off,
 FEBio Studio will use the material colors to display the model in the Graphics View.
\end_layout

Post Session Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The post model,
 i.e.
 the results and all the plots and other items added,
 can be saved to a Post Session File (PSF).
 The PSF is an xml-formatted file that contains the contents of the post model,
 and all the information necessary for FEBio Studio to reconstruct the model.
 The default extension for a PSF is 
\emph on
fsps
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a PSF,

model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first XML element in the file will usually be the 
\emph on
model
\emph default
 tag,
 which is used to read a file,
 e.g.
 an FEBio xplt file.
 The 
\emph on
file
\emph default
 attribute specifies the filename.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<model file=
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point,
 FEBio Studio will try to read the file.
 If reading the file fails,
 FEBio Studio will not process the rest of the session file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
model 
\emph default
tag can also contain a 
\emph on
type 
\emph default
attribute instead of a 
\emph on
file 
\emph default
attribute.
 This is used for creating models using a specialized tool.
 This can be used for instance for creating models via the 
\emph on
Kinemat
\emph default
 tool.
 See the examples below for how this works.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Chapter
Visualizing 3D Image Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has several capabilities for rendering and overlaying 3D image data.
 In order to visualize a 3D image,
 you must first load a 3D image stack into the active model.
 Then,
 you need to attach one of the 3D image rendering tools to the image stack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Loading 3D image data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio uses SimpleITK to read and manipulate image data,
 and so it supports reading a large number of image formats.
 At the moment,
 FEBio Studio does only supports single channel,
 8-bit images.
 When a higher bit image is loaded in,
 it is scaled down to 8 bits.
 Multichannel images (including color images) cannot be read in at all.
 To load image data,
 select the File
\backslash
Import Image from the main menu,
 and then select the type of image that you would like to import,
 which will show the standard File Open dialog box.
 Locate the image file on the file system and click OK.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default,
 the image data will be loaded into the active model.
 Thus,
 if you wish to view the image on top of a FE model,
 you first need to load that model,
 make sure it is active one,
 and then load the image data.
 When the image data is loaded in,
 a 3D volume renderer will be added to your model,
 displaying the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supported Image Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Raw Raw images contain no header information,
 and so in order to import them,
 you must provide information about the physical location of the image,
 and the physical and pixel dimensions of the image.
 When you import a raw image,
 a dialog box will appear where you can enter this information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DICOM DICOM images are read using SimpleITK.
 In order to load in a sequence of DICOM images,
 simply select one of the DICOM files from the File Dialog.
 FEBio Studio uses builtin SimpleITK functionality to parse the header data of the DICOM images to locate and read all of the files that belong to the same dataset as the file you specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TIFF TIFF images are read using SimpleITK.
 To load in a TIFF image,
 simple select it from the File Dialog.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
OME
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

TIFF OME TIFF images are read using SimpleITK.
 To load in an OME TIFF image,
 you should select the xml file containing the OME header data from the File Dialog.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Image
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Sequence If you have a sequence of 2D image files that together make up a single 3D image,
 you can load them in using this option.
 Simply select all of the images files that correspond to your image stack in the File Dialog.
 To ensure that they are loaded in the proper order,
 please make sure that they are organized alphabetically by file name.
 Do not use this option to load in a sequence of DICOM files.
 Use the DICOM option instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Image GUI Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio has various GUI elements dedicated to viewing and manipulating image data.
 Some of these GUI elements only appear when an image is selected from the model tree in an open model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Properties Box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image properties box will appear in the Model panel when you select an image in the model tree.
 The box has three tabs:
 
\emph on
Properties
\emph default
,
 
\emph on
Filters
\emph default
,
 and 
\emph on
Histogram
\emph default
.
 The Properties tab shows the physical bounds of the image in real space,
 and allows you to edit them.
 The Filters tab allows you to add,
 edit,
 and apply various filters to the images (please see the section on Filters for more information).
 The Histogram tab displays a histogram of the data from the selected image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
3D Image Settings Panel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3D Image Settings Panel will only be visible after an image has been selected.
 It allows you to customize various display settings for the current image.
 These display settings will be remembered for each image,
 and will be used across all display modes for the image.
 The settings include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Alpha Scale:

\emph on
 
\series default
\emph default
Sets the overall alpha scale,
 which scales the transparency of the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Gamma correction:

\series default
 Sets the gamma correction factor,
 which applies a nonlinear scaling of the image intensity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hue/Saturation/Luminance:
 
\series default
Sets the hue (or color),
 saturation,
 luminance level of the primary color.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Intensity:
 
\series default
Set the minimum and maximum cutoff image intensity.
 Voxels with an intensity below the minimum (maximum) value will be rendered with a transparency set to the value of the minimum (maximum) value of the
\emph on
 alpha range
\emph default
 setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Alpha Range:

\series default
 Sets the minimum and maximum alpha (transparency) values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Clip X/Y/Z:
 
\series default
Sets the min and max image clipping values for the X,
 Y,
 and Z planes.
 This allows users to only show a region of interest instead of the whole 3D image.

\begin_layout Subsection
Slice View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To access the Slice View,
 click the Slice View button on the Image Toolbar.
 This view shows slices of the image in each of the cardinal directions,
 along with a 3D render of the image which shows the corresponding location of each of the slices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below each of the slices,
 the direction of the slice is displayed along with the index of the slice in that direction and a slider.
 You can change which slice is displayed by either editing the slice index number,
 dragging the slider,
 or hovering over the slice and scrolling with your mouse wheel.
 As a given slice is moved,
 the corresponding slice on the 3D render will move with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Slice Sequence View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To access the Slice Sequence View,
 click the Slice Sequence View button on the Image Toolbar.
 This view allows you to automatically step through the slices of your image at a fixed interval.
 This is particularly useful if your image data consists of 2D images taken at different times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below the slice,
 there are various controls for this view.
 The Play/Pause button will start or stop the animation.
 The Interval value is the amount of time in milliseconds that the view will pause between each slice.
 Its default value is 40ms,
 which corresponds to 25 frames per second.
 The Slice Direction dropdown allows you to change from which direction the slice be shown.
 The number and slider next to the Slice Direction dropdown show the current slice index and relative slice position.
 The slice index can be changed manually by editing the slice index number,
 dragging the slider,
 or hovering over the slice and scrolling with your mouse wheel.
 If,
 however,
 the view is currently animating,
 the value will be automatically advanced as soon as it is edited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio Studio allows you to apply various filters to your images.
 These features are still under development,
 and as such there are not yet many filters available.
 In order to add,
 edit,
 or apply filters to your image,
 select the image from the Model Tree,
 then select the Filters tab in the 3D Image box in the Model panel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding,
 Removing,
 and Editing Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Filter GUI consists of two boxes,
 the Filters box and the Filter Properties box,
 and an Apply button.
 Due to the time-intensive nature of some filters,
 filters are only applied to the image when you click the Apply button.
 The effects of any addition,
 removal,
 editing,
 or reordering of filters will not be applied to the image until the Apply button is clicked.
 The following actions can be done in the Filter GUI:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To add a new filter,
 click the green plus icon to the right of the Filters box.
 This will open a dialog box which will allow you to select the type of filter you'd like to add.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To remove a filter,
 select it from the list of filters,
 and click the red X icon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To change the order in which filters are applied,
 simply drag and drop the filters in the Filters box to reorder them.
 The filters will be applied in order from top to bottom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To change a filter's properties,
 select the filter from the Filters box.
 The filter's properties will appear,
 and can be edited in the Filter Properties box.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Available Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image filtering functionality in FEBio Studio is new,
 and under active development.
 As such,
 there are only a small number of filters currently available.
 Many more filters will be added soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three filters currently available:
 a threshold filter,
 a mean image filter,
 and a Gaussian blur filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The threshold filter allows you to set a minimum and maximum intensity value for your image.
 Pixel values below your minimum will be set to 0,
 those above your maximum will be set to 255,
 and all other pixel values will be scaled between 0 and 255 linearly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean image filter will assign each pixel the value of the average of all surrounding pixels within a given radius.
 The X,
 Y,
 and Z radii can each be set individually.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussian blur filter applies a Gaussian blur to the image.
 The sigma value of the Gaussian distribution can be specified in the filter properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any other filters that may appear should be considered experimental for now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Other 3D Image Visualization Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a 3D image stack is loaded you can attach several image renderers to visualize the image data in the Graphics View.
 Before you add an image renderer,
 make sure the correct image stack is selected in the Model Viewer.
 In the following section,
 the different image renderers are described.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Other 3D Image Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image Map Tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Image Map Tool (found on the Tools tab of the Build Panel) is used to map intensity values from a 3D Image onto an FE mesh that exists inside the image domain.
 To use this tool you must first import a 3D Image,
 select the FE object onto which you want the intensity values to be mapped,
 and then run the tool.
 After running the tool,
 a new Mesh Data object will be created and added to the model tree.
 
\end_layout

 method to help nodes on the surface of a mesh to be assigned the correct value (see below for more details).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
 - The intensity value cutoff at which to stop projecting a surface node inward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
 - The maximum number of voxels to search when projecting nodes inward.
 The default value of 
\emph on

\emph default
 is usually sufficient.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Normalize
\emph default
 - When checked,
 the values of the resulting data map will always range between 0 and 1.
 When left unchecked,
 the values of the data map will be read directly from the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Filter
\emph default
 - When checked,
 an editable graph similar to the Curve Editor (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:mylabel19"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

) will be shown.
 This graph can be used to create a curve through which the data sampled from the image will be passed before being written to the data map.
 If the 
\emph on
Normalize
\emph default
 option is checked,
 the normalization will occur before the data is passed to the filter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three different methods that can be used for sampling the image.
 Each method may be useful with different combinations of mesh and voxel density.
 It is important to choose the correct method to ensure that the tool accurately samples your image.
 The 
\emph on
Sample Image at Nodes
\emph default
 method is best in most situations,
 but due to its comlexity,
 it is dicussed last.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Sample at Element Centroids
\emph default
 method samples the image at the location of each element's centroid and assigns the value to that element,
 resulting in a single value for each element.
 The value of the sample is linearly interpolated between voxels in the image.
 This method works well when the FE elements in the mesh are similar in size to the image's voxels,
 or smaller than the voxels.
 If the elements in the mesh are considerably larger than the voxels,
 high frequency data in the image will be lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Average Intensity Over Elements
\emph default
 method loops over every element in the mesh,
 and finds all of the voxels in the image whose centroids lie inside the current element.
 It then takes the average of those voxel values,
 and assigns that average to the element.
 This method works well when the FE elements are considerably larger than the image's voxels,
 and tends to act as a sort of low-pass filter for the image data.
 This method is not recommended for use when the FE elements are of a similar size to the image's voxels,
 or smaller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Sample Image at Nodes
\emph default
 method samples the image at the location of each node in the FE mesh,
 and assigns the value to that node,
 resulting in a single value for each node in the mesh.
 The value of the sample is linearly interpolated between voxels in the image.
 This method works well when the FE elements in the mesh are similar in size to the image's voxels,
 or smaller than the voxels.
 This method also provdes the 
\emph on
Project Surface Nodes Inward
\emph default
 parameter which can be used to help nodes on the surface of a mesh to be assigned the correct value,
 as explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often the case that an FE mesh does not simply cover the entire domain of the image,
 but rather oulines some prominent feature in the image,
 such as a bone (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
The nodes on the surface of this FE mesh lie slightly outside the bounds of the bone in the image,
 and so when the Image Map Tool samples the values for these nodes,
 it will sample a value from the background of the image,
 rather than the bone.
 The 
\emph on
Project Surface Nodes Inward
\emph default
 option helps to mitigate this.
 When this option is enabled,
 the Image Map tool projects each node on the surface of the FE mesh inward along its surface normal until it enounters a voxel whose value meets or exceeds a user-specified threshold,
 and assigns that voxel's value to the node.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In more detail,
 the 
\emph on
Project Surface Nodes Inward

 option works as follows.
 For each node on the surface of the FE mesh it will first check the value of the voxel at the node's location.
 If the value is greater than or equal to the value specified in the 
\emph on
Surface Threshold
\emph default
 parameter,
 then it will assign that voxel's value to the node,
 and move on to the next node.
 However,
 if the value of that voxel is less than the 
\emph on
Surface Threshold
\emph default
,
 then it will travel in a direction opposite of the node's surface normal,
 until it encounters a new voxel.
 It will check the value of that voxel,
 and if it meets or exceeds the 
\emph on
Surface Threshold
\emph default
 then it will assign that voxel's value to the node,
 otherwise it will move on to the next voxel in line.
 This search continues until either a suitable voxel is found,
 or until it has searched a number of voxels equal to the value stored in the 
\emph on
Max Search Depth
\emph default
 parameter.
 If the tool is unable to find a suitable voxel before that point,
 it assigns the node the value of the voxel closest to the node.

Fiber ODF Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Fiber ODF (Orientation Distribution Function) analysis feature in FEBio Studio is a tool designed to bridge the gap between experimental imaging data and finite element modeling.
 This analysis calculates ODFs directly from 3D image data,
 providing an accurate and detailed representation of the anisotropic material properties.

Type I collagen hydrogel image volume and its fibril orientation distribution function (ODF) characterized using our image analysis technique.
 (A) Isometric view of the image dataset,
 exhibiting collagen fibrils that are largely oriented along the X-direction.
 The dataset was acquired with a multiphoton microscope and pre-processed to correct for systematic distortions and improve contrast.
 (B) Top view of the first slice in the image stack,
 highlighted in a red dashed box in panel A.
 The image demonstrates the dataset is composed of fibrils that have considerable dispersion and some spatial heterogeneity.
 (C) Isometric view of the fiber ODF characterized over the entire volume.
 The ODF is visualized with the radial representation,
 where the probability of each direction is represented by its distance from the origin and a colormap.
 (D) Top and front views of the ODF.
 These views show the predominant orientation of the fibrils is along the X-axis and the dispersion is primarily within the XY plane.

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis removes the need to rely on idealized or parametric approximations of fiber orientation distrubutions by enabling the direct use of experimentally measured,
 high-resolution,
 non-parametric ODFs.
 This approach eliminates the loss of detail and accuracy that often accompanies parametric fitting,
 providing a more faithful representation of real-world materials.
 It allows users to subdivide image domains into spatial subregions,
 customize processing parameters,
 and visualize the resulting ODFs alongside the original image data.
 The resulting ODF information can then be copied into a constitutive model designed to utilize this orientation information in FEBio.

.
 However,
 a brief explanation follows.
 After some minimal preprocessing with a Butterworth filter,
 a 2D Fourier transform is applied to the volumetric image.
 The power spectrum is computed from the Fourier domain representation of the image.
 The power spectrum is then summed along the frequencies to determine the contribution to each direction in space.
 This results in a condensed power spectrum defined on the unit sphere.
 The power spectrum is then discretized on the unit sphere by dividing the surface into equal-area triangles using a tessellated icosahedron.
 The ODF is then obtained by applying the Q-ball algorithm to the condensed power spectra.
 The resulting ODF is then represented using spherical harmonics based on Legendre polynomials.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Butterworth filter is applied to the image before the Fourier analysis.
 It removes unwanted noise by attenuating high and low frequency noise in the image.
 The high and low frequency cutoff values can be specified along with the Butterworth fraction and steepness.
 The Butterworth fraction defines the fraction of the frequency spectrum retained.
 A low fraction (e.g.
 0.2) focuses on broad trends and removes small,
 sharp variations (high-frequency noise).
 A high fraction (e.g.
 0.8) retains more detail but risks including noise.
 The Butterworth steepness controls how sharply the filter transitions between retaining and attenuating frequencies.
 A high steepness value creates a sharp cutoff,
 effectively eliminating unwanted frequencies but may risk distorting the signal if the cutoff is too aggressive.
 A low steepness value creates a smoother transition,
 which may allow some noise to pass but avoids abrupt changes that could distort the ODF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to reduce the storage size of the resulting ODFs,
 they are represented using spherical harmonics based on Legendre polynomials.
 The user is able to choose a harmonic order for the spherical harmonic representation of the ODFs,
 and it is important to insure that a reasonable value is chosen for a given dataset.
 A higher harmonic order (e.g.
 20) allows for finer angular resolution,
 capturing sharp directional features in the ODF,
 but increases computational cost and memory usage.
 A lower harmonic order (e.g.
 10) produces a smoother,
 lower-resolution ODF representation,
 reducing computational demand,
 but may miss fine details.
 It is generally best to choose the lowest harmonic order that captures the most important features of a given ODF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases,
 the ODF calculated from the image data may be adequately described by either an ellipsoidal fiber distribution (EFD),
 or a Von-Mises distribution (VM3),
 rather than the full,
 non-parametric ODF.
 Using either the EFD or VM3 representations of the ODF can reduce the necessary computation time during an FE analysis.
 The Fiber ODF Analysis tool can also perform a fitting analysis on the calculated ODFs.
 If this option is enabled then,
 for each ODF,
 an optimization routine is run to calculate the parameters for both EFD and VM3 representations that most closely match the original ODF.
 If an EFD or VM3 representation is used in place of the full ODF,
 care should be taken to ensure that this approximation does not significantly alter the FE results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once these parameters are set,
 the analysis may be started by clicking the 
\emph on

\emph default

 and then choosing to either run the analysis for the currently selected subvolume,
 or for all subvolumes.

Continuous Fiber Distribution
\emph default

 with its own distribution type,

 (Please see the FEBio User Manual on continuous fiber distributions for more information).
 The Fiber ODF material takes any number of ODFs as parameters,
 each with a position in space,
 and a list of spherical harmonic coefficients.
 When an FE simulation is run using this material,
 some preprocessing is done on the ODFs in order to reduce the computational load during the simulation.
 The following is a description of these preprocessing steps.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to prevent sharp changes in the fiber direction between elements,
 a unique ODF is interpolated for each element in the mesh based on the element’s physical distance from the nearby ODFs in the discrete ODF field.
 This interpolation is done using a weighted-mean approach utilizing the objective distance metric afforded by the Fisher-Rao inner product space 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rauff_algorithmic_2024"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This results in a unique ODF for each finite element in the domain of the constitutive model which smoothly transitions between ODFs defined in each of the original image's subdivisions.
 If only a single ODF is defined for the domain (in other words,
 if the image was not subdivided before the analysis) then this step is skipped and the original ODF is used for all elements in the domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constitutive models using continuous fiber distributions require an efficient integration scheme over the unit sphere to compute stress contributions from the fiber family.
 Because there is no analytical representation of these non-parametric ODFs,
 this integration is performed by sampling the values of the ODFs at its defined points.
 To ensure faithful representation of the ODF,
 all ODF calculations up to this point in the process use a high resolution,
 pre-defined set evenly-spaced points on the unit sphere.
 Integrating the stress contributions across the ODFs at their full resolution proved to be prohibitively computationally expensive,
 as this integration must occur at every integration point in the FE mesh for each stress calculation in the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this issue,
 we developed a mechanism to reduce the number of sampling points on the ODF using an approach based on finite element remeshing technology.
 The gradient of each ODF is calculated,
 and a triangulated mesh of the ODF probability surface and its gradient is passed to the mmg remeshing library.
 The mmg algorithm remeshes a surface of triangular elements,
 adjusting the relative nodal density of the ODF mesh based on the magnitude of the gradient,
 resulting in a higher sampling density in areas of high curvature while reducing the overall number of sample points,
 thereby preserving sharp changes in orientation (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The density of the ODF’s sampling points has been greatly reduced in the regions of the ODF where there is little variation in the ODF’s value,

\end_layout

\end_inset

The number of integration points in the remeshed ODFs varies depending on the ODF topology,
 but the number points is generally reduced by about two orders of magnitude.
 Since the resampling of the ODFs only takes place once,
 at the beginning of the FE analysis,
 the time required for the remeshing step is small relative to the overall time involved in a FE analysis.
 The reduction in points dramatically increases the speed of stress computations without significantly altering the results.

TETGEN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
File format used by the TetGen software.
 TetGen typically splits the mesh into two separate files,
 a .node file,
 which contains the nodal coordinates and .ele file,
 which contains the element connectivity.
 The TetGen file reader expects the .ele file and will automatically look for a .node file that has the same file name.
 So,
 for example,
 if the .ele file is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mymesh.ele
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 then the file reader will look for a .node file called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mymesh.node
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the same file folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
RAW
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RAW format is used to define a 3D stack of image data.
 The RAW file reader will import the image data and generate a hexahedral mesh that has the same number of elements in x,
 y,
 and z as the image dimensions.
 The elements are partitioned based on the grayscale levels in the image.
 For instance,
 for a black-and-white image,
 two parts will be created,
 one for all the elements that correspond to the black part of the image,
 and one for all the elements that correspond to the white part of the image.
 
\end_layout
