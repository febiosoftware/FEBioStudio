        _NSGetExecutablePath  copies  the  path  of the executable
        into the buffer and returns 0 if the path was successfully
        copied  in the provided buffer. If the buffer is not large
        enough, -1 is returned and the  expected  buffer  size  is
        copied  in  *bufsize.  Note that _NSGetExecutablePath will
        return "a path" to the executable not a "real path" to the
        executable.  That  is  the path may be a symbolic link and
        not the real file. And with  deep  directories  the  total
        bufsize needed could be more than MAXPATHLEN.
